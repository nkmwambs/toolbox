Cutting out of jiggers is a painful process and often all jiggers cannot be removed in one sitting. The wounds are painful and causes difficulties for victims in their daily activities such as walking, attending school and playing among others.\n\nThe main objective of this initiative is to reduce tragedy faced by people infected by jiggers in Malanga community as they face social stigma, shame and discomfort. The natural remedy for jiggers which is under SGD Goal 3 (Good health and well being) is not only affordable to people within Malanga community but it is effective and the process is not painful thus attaining good health and well being of people within the community. \n\nThe youths of Malanga Child Development Centre came up with this idea to eradicate jiggers within the community and as a way of giving back to the entire society as the chemicals are expensive and most people can't cant afford them. This project has enabled younger children to concentrate in class , improved school attendance in feeder schools and helped to improve the general health and hygiene of the beneficiaries, caregivers and the community at large.\n\n\n","physicallink":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/-IgC81w4gyM","physicalphotos":"[{ \"comment\":\"KE0812 Youths with an initiative on natural ways of jigger treatment\",\"size\":\"4046.379\",\"name\":\"IMG_20190522_105110.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_p5p49z4fuvzgat2\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"comment\":\"KE0812 Mixing the natural ingredients \",\"size\":\"4408.143\",\"name\":\"IMG_20190522_105223.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_25yajf5vc2nbknx\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"3986.904\",\"name\":\"KE0812%20Natural%20ingredients%20for%20jigger%20treatment.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_3whtwn6rinngipv\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" }]","physicalphotos[filecount]":"3","socialwriteup":"","sociallink":"","socialphotos":"","socialphotos[filecount]":"0","cognitivewriteup":"","cognitivelink":"","cognitivephotos":"","cognitivephotos[filecount]":"0","spiritualwriteup":"","spirituallink":"","spiritualphotos":"","spiritualphotos[filecount]":"0","caregiverwriteup":"","caregiverlink":"","caregiverphotos":"","caregiverphotos[filecount]":"0","protectionwriteup":"","protectionlink":"","protectionphotos":"","protectionphotos[filecount]":"0"}},{"37":{"id":"37","submitdate":"2019-06-07 11:28:11","lastpage":"6","startlanguage":"en","seed":"1178172287","token":"ke809nyagokocdc","startdate":"2019-05-20 08:59:20","datestamp":"2019-06-07 11:28:11","physicalwriteup":"The Discipleship program at Nyagoko CDC targets beneficiaries from as low as 3 years.

These absolutely triggered us to develop a platform that with no doubt would create a more positive change to the young ones through assisting them to make a U-turn to their lives and enable them to move away from their comfort zones.\nThe following are some of the dangers that the youths are ideally exposed to: -\nDrug abuse, Sexual Immorality, Early aggressive behavior, Boredom, Depression, Curiosity, Stress and Peer Pressure\nMeasures taken;\n\uf0d8\tWe have been organizing youth seminars to encourage open communication among the youths and educate them on dangers of drug abuse and peer pressure which remains to be the main victims of success and change. Through these seminars we get to assist the youths with inspirational books to help them in their day to day challenges.\n\uf0d8\tWe have also developed a platform through which we send them every morning and evening inspirational messages to help them move and create a massive change and confidence to lead themselves. These messages impact a lot of positive influence and attitude in them and most of them end up making a U-turn to their lives.\n\uf0d8\tWe have also come up with debate club in which we encourage open communication and dialogues pertaining the social issues. This has now motivated the youths on issues affecting their school performances.\n\uf0d8\tWe have also encouraged a leadership forum in which the elder youths get to advice and share experience with the young ones.\nMotivational Speakers we emulate\nTo make this initiative lucrative and more purposeful and of value, we collect messages from people of great influence by following their twitter handles which is full of Wisdom. We follow people like Chris Kirubi, a well-known Kenyan Investor, in his handle he writes motivational messages directed to the Youths. We also follow Pst. Joel Osteen and his wife Victoria who are full of wisdom and write more on Christian issues affecting people. We follow sports quotes; we also follow motivational and inspirational quotes. We also follow Robert Kiyosaki, well known for his book \u2018Rich Dad, Poor Dad\u2019 and he has been of great help on personal finance issues.\nAll of these twitter quotes are shared directly to the youths of Ngomola CDC who never fail to have a phone even if it\u2019s a \u2018Kabambe\u2019. When they come for holidays most of their time is dedicated to these small phones and they buy SMS bundles which are cheaper. Instead of allowing them misuse these phones by texting messages not worthy building their future, we saw it best we be sharing with them the motivational messages every morning and evening. The response from them was highly appreciated and wished to be receiving more of this on a daily basis.\nIn conclusion, we intend to extend our initiative largely to not only the youths but also to their parents, guardians, neighbors and the country at large.\n","sociallink":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eYcmsUxh2nM&t=15s","socialphotos":"[{ \"title\":\"KE0229 - Youth Contacts\",\"comment\":\"Some of the Contacts from the youths\",\"size\":\"5371.502\",\"name\":\"KE0229-%23MotivateYouths%20%283%29.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_w8x5mrcgwywcyaq\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"KE0229- Shared Sms\",\"comment\":\"Sample messages shared\",\"size\":\"583.455\",\"name\":\"KE0229-%23MotivateYouths%20%285%29.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_6ehdmyjnd7xhs4b\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"KE0229 - Twiter Messages\",\"comment\":\"Sample Twitter Sms from Sports Motivation\",\"size\":\"585.933\",\"name\":\"KE0229-%23MotivateYouths6.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_fefmf6kkuqvch6u\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"KE0229 - Twitter Sms\",\"comment\":\"Sample sms from Robert Kiyosaki\",\"size\":\"669.236\",\"name\":\"KE0229-%23MotivateYouth.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_9c3m425aqx8nu3y\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" }]","socialphotos[filecount]":"4","cognitivewriteup":"","cognitivelink":"","cognitivephotos":"","cognitivephotos[filecount]":"0","spiritualwriteup":"","spirituallink":"","spiritualphotos":"","spiritualphotos[filecount]":"0","caregiverwriteup":"","caregiverlink":"","caregiverphotos":"","caregiverphotos[filecount]":"0","protectionwriteup":"","protectionlink":"","protectionphotos":"","protectionphotos[filecount]":"0"}},{"65":{"id":"65","submitdate":"2019-05-29 17:25:25","lastpage":"6","startlanguage":"en","seed":"1252865609","token":"ke826aickarima","startdate":"2019-05-20 11:07:13","datestamp":"2019-05-29 17:25:25","physicalwriteup":"","physicallink":"","physicalphotos":"","physicalphotos[filecount]":"0","socialwriteup":"","sociallink":"","socialphotos":"","socialphotos[filecount]":"0","cognitivewriteup":"","cognitivelink":"","cognitivephotos":"","cognitivephotos[filecount]":"0","spiritualwriteup":"","spirituallink":"","spiritualphotos":"","spiritualphotos[filecount]":"0","caregiverwriteup":"George Kuria is a beneficiary at AIC Karima and live with her mother Lucy Wanjiku a window of 4 children one boy and 3 girls .George was recruited in the project in 2009 after death of their father who was the sole bread winner, This affected George and her sisters education and ware sent out of school frequently due to lack of school fees and George dream for completing education was almost impossible \nAfter George was recruited in program in 2009 his dreams ware revived but her sisters were still experiencing more challenge due to financial constrains in the family.

This has made her live a frustrating life, relying on well-wishers and street passersby\u2019s\ncontributions.\n\nShe hit the breaking point during her last pregnancy. She developed a health complication in her second\ntrimester. She was too weak to go to the streets and she couldn\u2019t afford the medical attention she\nneeded.\n\nFortunately, she was directed to the Project\u2019s Survival program and got the help she desired. By the\nGrace of God, she gave birth to a healthy baby girl and named her Elizabeth Luvuno.\n\nThe project later registered her to the HVC support, through which she was able to get sufficient food\nfor her family and the baby. This facilitated her quick recovery and her baby grew strong and healthy\nsince she got enough breast milk.\n\nThrough individual and group trainings\/ counseling the CDC staff helped her believe that she can work\nand become independent financially. That is when she identified her desire to become a tailor.\n\nThis presented a problem however. She could not join the tailoring class because she could not rock the\nsewing machine paddle like the other caregivers - her legs were completely paralyzed. Even so, her\ndesire did not die.\n\nThe project was able to acquire a special sewing machine that she could use. While other caregivers\nused their legs to run the machine, she used her hands and sewed just as perfectly. The machine was\ndesigned such that the sewing mechanism is driven by hand rather than by foot.\n\nShe designs and makes uniforms, dresses and shirts for sale, earning her a living she is proud of. She is\nable to provide food and shelter for her kids.\n\nShe is joyful that the project did not dismiss her desire to become a tailor, especially when no hope\nseemed attainable.\n\nMoses Owino\u2019s Mother\n\nOnce a hard-working mother of two and a dedicated wife, Moses Owino\u2019s mother could hardly believe it\nwhen life threw all sorts of challenges at her.\n\nHer business (vending vegetables outside the town market) collapsed when the county council\ndemolished her kiosk to pave way for a government road expansion project. And she was left with two\nchildren at a time when she did not have any source of income.\n\nFortunately, she was introduced to the KE 504 FCP where she was introduced to a table banking group.\nShe would save the little she got from hawking home-made samosas and managed to start a salon\nbusiness from her savings.\n\nShe was determined and dedicated to everything she did.

This can be achieved by obtaining relevant skills that is formal and informal skills. African inland church Lochorai child development center is focused on ensuring that every beneficiary is able to obtain a skill that is current and future job relevant. To ensure that we focus on every beneficiary we facilitate those that are academically talented to join colleges and universities to continue with their studies in order to obtain skills in the formal sector. And those that are not talented in academic we take them to tertiary colleges and polytechnics where they can also obtain skill.\n\nMost of the time the focus is on well-performing students where we forget those that are not academically talented. Where are these beneficiaries taken? How are they equipped to compete in this competitive world? These are the answers that we were looking for and the gap we want to fill AIC Lochorai child development center has taken the beneficiaries to different life skill colleges and they have been doing great in all their selected areas.\n\nWe took a group of students to Comboni polytechnic who are doing mechanic, plumbing building and construction fashion and design and they have been performing well in all their areas. The mechanic students are doing great in their schools, they have mastered their course and in school well, they are now servicing vehicles in the school garage The graduates are teaming up together in order they can consolidate their own resources so that they can start their own garage since they have all the equipment\u2019s. Many of them have also been employed in local garages and they have stated earning a living and supporting themselves as they continue advancing their course.\nThe other group is the group that is doing catering and hospitality group. The group is also doing wonderful in that field. The group have joined together and they are able to do outside catering and even host an events. The group leader who is Geoffrey was not academically talented but took his course with great passion and his work has marketed him largely in the area. This has led him to incubate his idea of forming a group where they do outside catering. The group is called young caters where he is able to support himself and his sister who is in high school. Through him other beneficiaries who are part of the group are able to get exposure when he takes them in outside catering. He has already done successful work in one weeding and he is being recommended by many people in our area. He is also train survival caregivers in their bakery work thus able to pass his knowledge to this mothers so that they can also be entrepreneurs. He may not be gifted in academic but gifted in his catering work.

However, farming has proved to be a challenge due to the change in the weather pattern leading to decrease in income among the caregivers. As a result they are unable to adequately provide for their families. The situation is even worse among the pregnant and breastfeeding mothers because their young children need more attention thus they have limited time for casual jobs. \nAIC Lochorai launched survival program whose main is to ensure the survival of the mother and the child in Nov 2018. To achieve this goal, we embarked on training the mothers different skills to help them generate income. So far we have trained them beadwork and soap making skills. Most of them are now making soap since it does not require a lot of startup capital and it is not labor intensive. They are currently selling a littler of soap at ksh 60. The church is located next to Egerton University which provides ready market for the soap.\nThe skills gained has helped them generate extra income which they use to provide for their families. This has greatly reduced the dependency level among the caregivers.

On completion of the various planned activities the beneficiaries are awarded certificate on attained level in terms of bronze, Silver and finally the highest certificate award is the gold  that is given by the President himself through an invitation to state house. The program has enabled our youths to actively participate in various activities that enable them to gain skills and discover themselves .Our youths have improved their  inter personal skills through interacting with students from other schools and institutions and thus enhanced perspective about life. The main aim of the program is that participant\u2019s gain various skills that enable them serve their communities in the best way they can.  Some of the activities we participate in include expeditions, Visits to schools, Prisons and homes while   offering various services such as painting, cleaning-ups, mentor ship, spiritual nourishment. Through this program our beneficiaries have gone out  of their way by not just helping the program beneficiaries but also the  community at large through serving and  engaging them in benefiting activities therefore reducing negative peer pressure among children and youths in Korogocho slums. Through the program our beneficiaries are becoming leaders, mentors, sportsmen\/women, service men , business  people  just to mention a few.\nThe beneficiary\u2019s self-esteem is greatly growing   especially on those  who reach the gold level award this is because  together with their caregiver\u2019s ,project staffs and a few other beneficiaries  we are invited to state house for the Award ceremony which also includes many other youths from various schools and institution across the country.\nThe president\u2019s award whose patron is the president of Kenya   has activities assessed and monitored by volunteers from the office of the president. Each beneficiary has got a workbook where they record any activities that they participate in which is signed by supervisors. \nThe video attached is one of our beneficiaries in the President Award program KE3710595 Kevin Njoro.

empowerment is one of our objectives in our 2018-2020 strategic plan. One of the ways to empower the youth is to ensure they acquire skills which they can use to earn income. Over the years our youth have been training computer packages at a cost of ksh 5000 in the available institution at in the nearest town where they also pay ksh 100 as fare.  This has limited the number of youth acquiring the skill due to the limited resources in our project.  Computer literacy is very relevant to the youth because it connects them to the world and enable them research through the internet. In the world today people and especially the youth could be completely detached from the world happenings due to lack of computer know how. \r\nTo bridge this gap and ensure our youth are not left out in the digital era our church partnered with Computer For Schools Kenya in April 2019 to offer training in computer packages, entrepreneurship and responsible E waste management at a subsidized cost of ksh 1000.  Computer for schools Kenya offers the training through a digi truck which is a mobile truck fully furnished with twenty laptops and a projector which is solar powered. It is also furnished with chairs and tables becoming a ready class.  \r\nThe program has two levels of partnership; one is where the truck is pulled to the project and set to offer training to twenty students per session and can have four to five sessions in a single day. This translates to eighty to one hundred persons being trained in a day. The other way is where by Computer for Schools Kenya provides a curriculum and students are taught then they examine the students and certify them at a cost of ksh 2100 for secondary going youth and ksh. 500 for primary going pupils. In our case we partnered in both ways.  The digi truck was pulled to our project and eighty youth and caregivers were trained in a period of one month and graduated on 6th May 2019 with a certificate in computer packages, entrepreneurship and responsible E waste management. \r\nDuring the graduation ceremony local leaders including the area member of county assembly, representative from the office of the women representative and the mother of the governor graced the occasion. This was another opportunity to mobilize resources for the children and youth. The area MCA promised bursaries for the secondary going youth and the governor\u2019s mother promised story books and chicks to the youth and caregivers to start raring chicken as a way of generating income with the knowledge gained through entrepreneurship training. This will ensure families and the community at large is impacted greatly. \r\nThe training on E waste management was an eye opener to the youth. Most of the time unwanted electronics and batteries that contain lead are thrown in our shambas, latrines and others in the rivers polluting the environment and also posing a great health risk to the people especially children who use the gadgets as playing items. After the training the youth have formed a group to be collecting the electronic waste as part of community service and engaging Computer for schools Kenya to help dispose them properly.  This will ensure that our environment is safe and children are secure.\r\n","cognitivelink":"","cognitivephotos":"[{ \"title\":\"\",\"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"2024.713\",\"name\":\"KE%200744%20-Youth%20in%20computer%20class.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_d7zucv6x8vz753z\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"\",\"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"2271.534\",\"name\":\"KE0744%20-youth%20during%20graduation.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_uj5zr2urjrit7mt\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"\",\"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"2088.866\",\"name\":\"KE0744-Mother%20to%20ther%20governor%20issue%20certificate%20%20to%20one%20of%20the%20youth.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_aa75seauzgz9cqc\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"\",\"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"2263.957\",\"name\":\"KE%200744-Area%20MCA%20issue%20certificate%20to%20one%20of%20the%20graduating%20youth.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_uk8k9bdh89psjyk\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"\",\"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"2055.613\",\"name\":\"KE0744-%20youth%20cut%20cake%20to%20mark%20graduation.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_ibnxnkh4u4jpbnh\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" }]","cognitivephotos[filecount]":"5","spiritualwriteup":"","spirituallink":"","spiritualphotos":"","spiritualphotos[filecount]":"0","caregiverwriteup":"","caregiverlink":"","caregiverphotos":"","caregiverphotos[filecount]":"0","protectionwriteup":"","protectionlink":"","protectionphotos":"","protectionphotos[filecount]":"0"}},{"165":{"id":"165","submitdate":"2019-06-18 15:06:51","lastpage":"6","startlanguage":"en","seed":"1608365665","token":"ke245rgckavetecdc","startdate":"2019-05-22 15:17:17","datestamp":"2019-06-18 15:06:51","physicalwriteup":"","physicallink":"","physicalphotos":"[]","physicalphotos[filecount]":"0","socialwriteup":"KE024500148 was overall and best in 400m 200m 100 m and relays.He convinced his parents to bring him back from a boarding school to a day school to come and attend the program .He was also the goal keeper of the winning football team","sociallink":"","socialphotos":"","socialphotos[filecount]":"0","cognitivewriteup":"","cognitivelink":"","cognitivephotos":"","cognitivephotos[filecount]":"0","spiritualwriteup":"","spirituallink":"","spiritualphotos":"","spiritualphotos[filecount]":"0","caregiverwriteup":"","caregiverlink":"","caregiverphotos":"","caregiverphotos[filecount]":"0","protectionwriteup":"","protectionlink":"","protectionphotos":"","protectionphotos[filecount]":"0"}},{"167":{"id":"167","submitdate":"2019-05-22 16:22:53","lastpage":"6","startlanguage":"en","seed":"935857584","token":"ke451pefakiwanjacdc","startdate":"2019-05-22 16:11:32","datestamp":"2019-05-22 16:22:53","physicalwriteup":"\u2018\u2018There was a lot of routine among the beneficiaries during the Saturday programmes. \u201d Says the Project Director.\nFootball by itself seemed hard at first but introduction of a professional sport coach brought out the fun in it.

This was a conclusion of the many meetings. \nWe received funds through CIV proposal to support the caregivers pig rearing project. Through the funds we were to distribute the first 30 sows and 2 boars to the interested pig farmers.\nThrough God miraculous ways, we were able to network with Faraja Latia in the same period where they donated to us fourteen more pigs.\nTherefore at the onset of this program we had forty six (46) pig farmers that were distributed to interested pig farmers.\nThe numbers has grown tremendously with almost hundred (100) project caregivers currently benefiting from this pig rearing project.\nThis has been made the case, as the agreement on pigs is that benefiting pig farmer has to give back two (2) piglets in three (3) months to the project that are given back to other interested pig farmers within our caregivers. \nBelow is a case scenario:-\nAlex Njuguna is one of the beneficiaries of Compassion international in Kiwanja P.E.F.A. church.

He then leased a piece of land in which he has reared approximately ninety five pigs all of which have multiplied from the one he received. \n \u201cI am thankful to compassion for the introduction into the pig rearing business.

Mtaa PEFA CDC) started to have more beneficiaries in the youth bracket, it\u2019s main concern was to get ways to ensuring  that the beneficiaries still get interested in attending programs at the project. This led to the project come up with activities for youth programming. These included sports.\n\nThe project apart from the various skills carried out at the project, we have games that some run every day evening and others run only on Saturdays and every day during holidays. This has made the beneficiaries  love the project and attendance have been great. \nOne of the most outstanding sport at the project is volleyball. It has greatly impacted the beneficiaries in a great way. This has happened through talent recognition in school leading to some of the beneficiaries receiving sponsorship in secondary schools thus relieving the caregivers of the burden of paying school fees. A group of girls started a volleyball team at their secondary school with no couch. From the training they receive at the project they were able to train other girls at the school thus forming a school team that participated for the first time  to the regional level during secondary school games. This has really motivated them thus don\u2019t miss project activities and has led to other beneficiaries showing great interest thus practicing with them.\n\nOne of the greatest achievement for the beneficiaries is having one of them being selected in the national volleyball team for under 21 years. This has really motivated the beneficiaries pay great attention to what they are taught at the project because they know God will use their talents and skills to have them sit with kings.\nIn the projects competitions the girls volleyball team has participated thrice in the national level. They were the 2017 champions and in 2018 they were the second position. We believe the beneficiaries will do great not only in academics but in their  God given talents. We bless God for the great opportunity that the churches through the projects are doing to ensure that the beneficiaries and their families are released from poverty in Jesus name\n\n","physicallink":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/bPHUceVbzJZs ","physicalphotos":"[{ \"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"128.983\",\"name\":\"ke0328%20nationals%20in%20Thogoto.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_w6ba75qy3h2xddg\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"125.935\",\"name\":\"ke0328%20champions%202017.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_c89sqnmnw4ppthw\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" }]","physicalphotos[filecount]":"2","socialwriteup":"","sociallink":"","socialphotos":"","socialphotos[filecount]":"0","cognitivewriteup":"","cognitivelink":"","cognitivephotos":"","cognitivephotos[filecount]":"0","spiritualwriteup":"","spirituallink":"","spiritualphotos":"","spiritualphotos[filecount]":"0","caregiverwriteup":"","caregiverlink":"","caregiverphotos":"","caregiverphotos[filecount]":"0","protectionwriteup":"","protectionlink":"","protectionphotos":"","protectionphotos[filecount]":"0"}},{"175":{"id":"175","submitdate":"2019-05-23 08:05:17","lastpage":"6","startlanguage":"en","seed":"1452578271","token":"ke387elckcdc","startdate":"2019-05-22 20:44:12","datestamp":"2019-05-23 08:05:17","physicalwriteup":"","physicallink":"","physicalphotos":"","physicalphotos[filecount]":"0","socialwriteup":"","sociallink":"","socialphotos":"","socialphotos[filecount]":"0","cognitivewriteup":"","cognitivelink":"","cognitivephotos":"","cognitivephotos[filecount]":"0","spiritualwriteup":"","spirituallink":"","spiritualphotos":"","spiritualphotos[filecount]":"0","caregiverwriteup":"","caregiverlink":"","caregiverphotos":"","caregiverphotos[filecount]":"0","protectionwriteup":"","protectionlink":"","protectionphotos":"","protectionphotos[filecount]":"0"}},{"177":{"id":"177","submitdate":"2019-05-27 12:10:37","lastpage":"6","startlanguage":"en","seed":"98511716","token":"ke438ctmurumbacdc","startdate":"2019-05-23 03:35:35","datestamp":"2019-05-27 12:10:37","physicalwriteup":"This is an empowerment strategy to release children from poverty through training caregivers.

Since July 2018, school uniforms are being made by the two caregivers. The two trainers together with the ten trainees have formed a group and registered for business purposes.

CHURCH  CDC SOCCER TEAM SUCCESS STORY\n Ushindi Baptist  Church cdc boys Soccer team was registered with the Federation of Kenya Football in the year 2017.Currently the team is playing in division one league in Football Kenya Federation. The team comprises of beneficiaries from the project and some youth from the surrounding community. The team currently have around 40 players who have been registered with Football Kenya federation .Recently the team was promoted to division one league from division two league. Majority of the youth in the team are both  Christians and muslims who are still in school and colleges in Mombasa County.This year the team is playing in division one league after a promotion as a result of good performance.The FCP has also registered the under 13years and 15 years soccer team in Football Kenya federation\n\n The team has also taken part in Mombasa cup which was sponsored by Federation of Kenya football, Neimar Five aside soccer tournament which was sponsored by Red bull and held at Uwanja wa Mbuzi and Kenya wildlife and tourism soccer tournament which was sponsored by Coca cola,ministry of  tourism and Kenya wildlife in 2018.The team also took part in this years Neymar Junior\u2019s(Brazil soccer super star)  Five aside soccer tournament which was held at Serani ground in Mombasa county where the team reached the quarter finals stage.\n          \nMost of the youth in our team are well discipline because of the high level of discipline which is required among the team members. Members who happens to have indiscipline issues, especially beneficiaries who miss coming to the project are normally suspended from playing matches  until they improve. The team has also attracted youths from the surrounding community who have joined the team.\n\nWe also have some sessions of discussing issues on drug and substance abuse because Likoni sub county has a major challenges on drug and substance abuse as well as youth gangs. We believe that with more support for  the soccer team, we will be able to make a  positive impact on more youth.\nWe are also looking forward to register the under 15years soccer team so that we can be able to nurture the talent and also give them an exposure from a tender age and even enroll them is soccer academies for better development of their talents.\n\nThe team also provides a   platform for the youth to show case their talent. The FKF league also plays a major part of developing talents of our beneficiaries because they are getting opportunity of playing tough league matches with experienced players something that has improved our team. We managed to win the soccer senior matches for Mombasa sub cluster tournament by defeating all the teams in our group. We defended the title and produced majority of the players who will form Mombasa sub cluster combined soccer team that will participate at the regional level\n\nChallenges:\nThe team still need more balls and boots for practice because the number of players keeps on growing as more youth are becoming interested and are joining the team. We also need cones for the players for use in training and soccer jerseys and bibs for the players. Another challenge is a playing ground for the players because our pitch is rocky and not friendly for playing soccer, Sometimes we are forced to go and practice in soccer pitches which are far from the ICP. We hope that if we overcome this challenges, we will go far and many of the youths will join leading soccer team in the country and even turn professionals.\n","physicallink":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Ad3_GKNCQO8&t=17s","physicalphotos":"[{ \"comment\":\"Football kenya federation 2019 league standing\",\"size\":\"129.15\",\"name\":\"Football%20kenya%20federation%202019%20league%20standing.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_tgy8pdkefd6k78v\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"comment\":\"ushindi Baptist church cdc senior soccer team during Neymar junior Five aside soccer tournament at Serani grounds in Mombasa county 2019\",\"size\":\"2641.723\",\"name\":\"ushindi%20Baptist%20church%20cdc%20senior%20soccer%20team%20during%20Neymar%20junior%20Five%20aside%20soccer%20tournament%20at%20Serani%20grounds%20in%20Mombasa%20county%202019.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_huvnqkiddpsp3tb\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"comment\":\"ushini baptist church cdc senior and junior soccer team\",\"size\":\"178.412\",\"name\":\"ushini%20baptist%20church%20cdc%20senior%20and%20junior%20soccer%20team.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_pssx8bbbkhfxgsz\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"comment\":\"Kenya wildlife and tourism soccer tournament at mombasa sports club in 2018\",\"size\":\"117.738\",\"name\":\"Kenya%20wildlife%20and%20%20tourism%20soccer%20tournament%20at%20mombasa%20sports%20club%20in%202018.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_nmht4pbzpy64ws7\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"comment\":\"ushindi Baptist church cdc senior soccer team during Neymar junior Five aside soccer tournament at Uwanja wa Mbuzi stadium in Mombasa county 2018\",\"size\":\"429.885\",\"name\":\"ushindi%20Baptist%20church%20cdc%20senior%20soccer%20team%20during%20Neymar%20junior%20Five%20aside%20soccer%20tournament%20at%20Uwanja%20wa%20Mbuzi%20stadium%20%20in%20Mombasa%20county%202018.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_ux7c92i99gfw8da\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" }]","physicalphotos[filecount]":"5","socialwriteup":"","sociallink":"","socialphotos":"","socialphotos[filecount]":"0","cognitivewriteup":"\nUSHINDI BAPTIST CHURCH CDC SUCCESS STORY OF CAREGIVERS EMPOWERMENT THROUGH SAVINGS GROUPS\n\nUshindi Baraka Self help group,Miracle and Kibali  are among  groups of  caregivers of ke505 ushindi Baptist Church,who joined Kenya ecumenical church loan fund- ECLOF after attending three  days training where they were taught business management skills back in 2015 . They started saving with the groups in order to get  loans. They got their first loans and boosted their various businesses.\nAfter  receiving  loans, their businesses  improved tremendously as  they wee able to increase their stocks thus making availability of variety of goods to their customers,hence attracting more customers. This enable them increase their profit margin as a result of increase in sales. Some of  them  can buy items in bulk and supply them to other small retailers.\n \nMost of the caregivers who have register has members of Eclof are now in a better position of meeting their family needs because they can now easily access loans to pay schools fees, pay rent as well as expand their businesses without worrying on where they will get financial support. They are also well equipped with the knowledge of running their business thus minimizing the risk of making losses. The caregivers have also learnt the importance of coming together and working as a team. In a team there is a room for sharing good business practices and ways of overcoming challenges where one person can not manage without getting support from a colleague. Ushindi Baraka self help group went father  to register the group and they are now in a better position of accessing other support from the government and the private sector. We have members of Baraka team who benefited from the Women Enterprise Funds(WEF)  kitty.Their first loan was ksh250,000 and second loan of ksh350,000 and in April this year 2019 they received a loan of ksh500,000.The group has also come up with uniforms which they used to identify themselves with during some occasions and events where self help groups are required in Mombasa county.\n\n   In 2015 under the leadership of  Ushindi Baptist church and CKE,the  groups  were brought together and given a donation of ksh461506 through ECLOF KENYA which was meant to enable them access loans by having large savings in their groups. The groups did not disappoint, they are doing well. Currently Ushindi Baraka which has 11 members has a savings of ksh451,927 from their eclof Kenya account  and  ksh478,000 that they received from WEF, Miracle group has a savings of ksh262,430 from 11 members and Kibali has a savings of ksh297,223 from 14 members. The groups have been saving between ksh300 and 200 when meeting on Mondays. Other groups have realize the importance of having a registration certificate for their group and they are now working on getting one for their groups so that they may also benefit like Baraka group members who are enjoying  WEF loans that  they accessing without  paying  interest. The groups also have bank accounts for their account B(money contributed by members to support them) which they  use to give loans to their members who in return, repay the loans with interest which is shared at the end of the year.\n\n       The number of caregivers who are meeting at the project is very encouraging because it shows how the caregivers have embrace the whole idea of saving as a group. The caregivers have learnt the hard times which is a head of the as a large numbers of their children are joining secondary schools and colleges, meaning that they will be required to dig more in their pockets for fees for their children and the amount that the project is offering them will not be enough.Its a good step towards a right direction.May the Load expand their boundaries.\n\n","cognitivelink":"","cognitivephotos":"[{ \"title\":\"Eclof kenya groups\",\"comment\":\"launching of ECLOF KENYA in 2015\",\"size\":\"3750.134\",\"name\":\"launching%20of%20ECLOF%20KENYA%20in%202015.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_yy2mshk7aun8icg\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"Eclof kenya launch photo\",\"comment\":\"chairman addressing caregivers during the launch in 2015\",\"size\":\"3683.634\",\"name\":\"chairman%20addressing%20caregivers%20during%20the%20launch%20in%202015.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_4hpff9993hhkbb7\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"Baraka self help group\",\"comment\":\"baraka self help group receiving 1st cheque of ksh150,000 from WEF in 2017\",\"size\":\"979.15\",\"name\":\"baraka%20self%20help%20group%20receiving%201st%20%20cheque%20of%20ksh150%2C000%20from%20WEF%20in%202017.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_5u59y8i8u2zaeuj\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"Baraka,kibali and Miracle group members\",\"comment\":\"Baraka,miracle & Kibali members during weekly meeting\",\"size\":\"4305.063\",\"name\":\"Baraka%2Cmiracle%20%26%20Kibali%20members%20during%20weekly%20meeting.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_b4rqvnhwhmdfjch\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"Ushindi baraka members\",\"comment\":\"ushindi baraka members receiving a cheque of ksh478000 from WEF\",\"size\":\"4381.312\",\"name\":\"ushindi%20baraka%20members%20receiving%20a%20cheque%20of%20ksh478000%20from%20WEF.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_tsz5dtu9wcazi4z\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" }]","cognitivephotos[filecount]":"5","spiritualwriteup":"","spirituallink":"","spiritualphotos":"","spiritualphotos[filecount]":"0","caregiverwriteup":"","caregiverlink":"","caregiverphotos":"","caregiverphotos[filecount]":"0","protectionwriteup":"","protectionlink":"","protectionphotos":"","protectionphotos[filecount]":"0"}},{"195":{"id":"195","submitdate":"2019-05-23 14:05:29","lastpage":"6","startlanguage":"en","seed":"279552920","token":"ke372rgchurumacdc","startdate":"2019-05-23 11:14:42","datestamp":"2019-05-23 14:05:29","physicalwriteup":"","physicallink":"","physicalphotos":"","physicalphotos[filecount]":"0","socialwriteup":"N\/A","sociallink":"N\/A","socialphotos":"","socialphotos[filecount]":"0","cognitivewriteup":"\nKE372RGC-HURUMA CDC YOUTH ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT\nYouth economic empowerment is essential for economic development of any country. It is about supporting young people to develop knowledge and skills that they need to succeed in the world of work .According to business daily Africa (www.business dailyafrica.com), Youth population in Kenya is about 20.3% of the population and it is above the world of 15.5%.This therefore means that their contribution to the economy of the country cannot be ignored. Youths in Kenya are category of the poor and vulnerable section of the society. Indeed youth who reside in the slums are more vulnerable than the rest, since they have no adequate skills and opportunities, unlike those from upper market areas. Youth economic empowerment is critically essential for youth residing in the slums, as many of double up to be the bread winners of the family.\nBeing cognizant of this fact; our child development center is taking keen interest in economically empowering the supported beneficiaries. We have noted that starting early enough to train the youth on self-reliance economically; will mitigate the protracted self-dependency that has been prevalent; not only to the care givers but to the community in this slum at large. In response to this; we have been running entrepreneurship\/business training to both care givers and the supported beneficiaries. It is out of this program that one of beneficiaries KE37200836 Samuel Otieno acquired business management skills and decided to start Sausage and egg boiling business. This is attending several lessons at the project on entrepreneurship and after facing serious challenge of transport to school. The aim of starting the business was to generate income that will support his transport expenses to school.\n","cognitivelink":"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1aQGtuthc9H7uYV0nyO681KdSvCVqZ2L-\/view?usp=sharing","cognitivephotos":"","cognitivephotos[filecount]":"0","spiritualwriteup":"N\/A","spirituallink":"N\/A","spiritualphotos":"","spiritualphotos[filecount]":"0","caregiverwriteup":"N\/A","caregiverlink":"N\/A","caregiverphotos":"","caregiverphotos[filecount]":"0","protectionwriteup":"N\/A","protectionlink":"N\/A","protectionphotos":"","protectionphotos[filecount]":"0"}},{"197":{"id":"197","submitdate":"2019-05-23 14:59:01","lastpage":"6","startlanguage":"en","seed":"1824969571","token":"ke917pceaevergreencdc","startdate":"2019-05-23 11:22:56","datestamp":"2019-05-23 14:59:01","physicalwriteup":"KE917 PCEA Evergreen is a center for innovation and articulation of ideas and skills aimed at impacting and empowering the lives of beneficiaries and caregivers.

The school being 1 year and 3 months old already has a population of 271 children, 200 sponsored children and 71 non-sponsored children. The school will continue to grow with the project and overtime shall become an IGA for the project.\n\nThe school project is unique because it has specific supporters who are committed to its infrastructural development.\n\nSecondly, having made the merger possible, the mass absenteeism of beneficiaries that fellowship on Saturday has been permanently dealt with and the rift between the church and Saturday denominations has reduced a great deal.\n\nCombining the program activities with normal school activities has improved the quality of learning and management of programs on both ends.\n","cognitivelink":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/EZUyg0kuBcE","cognitivephotos":"[{ \"title\":\"Talent nurturing\",\"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"4089.5480000000002\",\"name\":\"KE0273-BENEFICIARIES%20AT%20REGIONAL%20DRAMA%20FESTIVALS.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_xt2u7iimbqmfj8z\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"School that has been built by friends and supporters of the church\",\"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"3102.404\",\"name\":\"KE0273-CURRENT%20CLASSES.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_dvng3ubt23w8dsz\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"Where we started our programs and the school\",\"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"3091.822\",\"name\":\"KE0273-OLD%20%20CLASSES.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_xnt2725ahcvjr9t\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"Computer literacy for all our beneficiaries\",\"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"3412.944\",\"name\":\"KE0273-PP1%20COMPUTER%20SESSION.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_mw2k6wywuct52uq\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"Some of the beneficiaries in ECD class\",\"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"4152.8460000000005\",\"name\":\"KE0273-ECD%20TEAM.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_kwewwkmi7fhdv4x\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" }]","cognitivephotos[filecount]":"5","spiritualwriteup":"","spirituallink":"","spiritualphotos":"","spiritualphotos[filecount]":"0","caregiverwriteup":"","caregiverlink":"","caregiverphotos":"","caregiverphotos[filecount]":"0","protectionwriteup":"","protectionlink":"","protectionphotos":"","protectionphotos[filecount]":"0"}},{"201":{"id":"201","submitdate":"2019-05-31 13:32:08","lastpage":"6","startlanguage":"en","seed":"654936720","token":"ke333eapcnyalanikalolenicdc","startdate":"2019-05-23 11:44:11","datestamp":"2019-05-31 13:32:08","physicalwriteup":"Nyalani CDC have stood ensuring its beneficiaries are protected from any suffering in their lives by ensuring holistic approaching is key in its quest for the mission releasing children in Jesus name.\nIn ensuring physical development attained to all beneficiaries, the case of Josphat Hare a one year and 9 months home based beneficiary has been most successful story to the organization which brought hope to the family after long time spending money on their son who was born with flaccid paralysis.\nThe family spent over Forty thousand as hospital and clinic bills so as to enable the child have capability to walk like other children.

They include:\n       Sheep rearing project\t\n Happy group gathered the money and started buying sheep. One of them gave out a place to keep the sheep. The group currently has 100 sheep\u2019s with a value of one sheep being Kshs 6,000. They keep increasing overtime. They also buy and sell sheep at a profit. . After saving for some years they have an objective of doing a collective project. This initiative has really helped these families, incase one of them has a need; they sell some of the sheep and assist in meeting the need.  They also have a running bank account of which they save the profit they gain for future investments. Currently their savings stands at 150,000 shillings.\n        Small Businesses start up\t\nInitially, Caregivers were relying on help and on rare casual labor which was not sustaining the families. Ibonia group used the money they saved to help members start small businesses of selling Market food items. Each business is worth Kshs 40000. Currently twenty caregivers have running and profitable businesses which they rely on to meet their daily needs and for paying school fees of their children. Each caregiver involved in this business gets a profit of 400ksh per day. With time, the ICP has offered entrepreneurial skills to help them run their businesses\nBaraka za Mungu Self-help group have two daily cows which they collectively share duties when giving fodder. The profit they get from selling milk is saved in the caregivers Sacco.\nFarming\nThose caregivers who do not own land relied on casual labor which could not sustain them. Baraka self help group leased an acre of farming land for Kshs 25000 per year which they farm as a group. They save 20% of the profit, share 40% and the rest is ploughed back to the farm. After harvesting they source for good markets in the locality. This has made them make good economic strides and earn household incomes. The local agricultural extension officers help them with good agricultural practices. They are also in the process of opening a seedling shop for all farm products. They will run this business as a group\n       Skills training\nThe ICP offered knitting and sewing skills to the caregivers in groups of 20. They perfected their skills and in the last financial year they were able to Make centre uniform for the beneficiaries. They are still mobilizing to put up a tailoring shop. \n       Table banking\nAll the groups are engaged in table banking. They assist each other to pay the Monthly 100 shillings at the project. They have also saved a significant amount of money per group in their savings account. All the 14 caregiver groups have a revolving fund of ksh 350,000 which is increasing overtime due to the interest they earn. This made them register their own Sacco in November 2019 (KAKAMU SAVING AND CREDIT CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETY). They target to save an approximate of 500,000 by August 2019. Their Sacco has a running cereal shop. They are also in the process of setting up a boutique, Mpesa and bank agents. The Sacco will also start lending loans to the caregivers groups by august 2019.

Countries with a higher level of skills fare better to cope with the challenges of emerging economies in the present day world. KE 462 KAG KAMIRITHU is better placed in this regard, youths are our core focus for skill development in the FCP. We have a vast majority of beneficiaries in the productive age group. This provides a great opportunity to impact this growing population with a myriad of skills that the beneficiaries have interest in, with this in mind that benefits will flow to an individual, family and the society at large. This will only be possible if the young adults are healthy, educated and properly skilled. Part of our core program is to ensure that the youth are impacted with skills that will help them become economically self-sustaining. In this regard, we have had success stories of the impact of these skills in the individual lives of our beneficiaries.\nThe FCP success story starts with 80% of the youths completing primary and secondary education without dropping out of school bearing in mind the many challenges the youth face will schooling.  As they complete their education the beneficiaries are taken through career guidance session and organized seminars, where they are given information concerning career of their choice and courses they want to undertake, with the beneficiary\u2019s rich with information on the available courses, they are sent to the field to collect at least 3 brochures fee structures and any useful information needed for their admission. Our youth beneficiaries have been proactive in this area, most submitted their courses of interest and the project assisted in paying for their technical courses. The FCP has also partnered with Premier Professional Institute, we have an MOU where they offer to train our beneficiary\u2019s computer packages free as they wait to join the institution to pursue courses of their choice.  PRISCILLA WAIRIMU 3009 takes a big part in the video as the oldest beneficiary in the project who has completed her 2years course in dressmaking, her competency in her skill secured her a job at Bata Shoe Company where she is earning a decent living. She helps her family in paying for her other small sibling's school fees and support her parent in meeting the household needs. The FCP has our first beneficiary to join University KE046203025 at JKUAT University. Other youths are pursuing different course namely: KE46203042 PLUMBING, KE46203016 PLUMBING, KE46203000 to join the campus in Sep 2019 currently doing driving, KE46203008 HAIR, AND BEAUTY, KE46203001 MECHANICAL ENGINEERING, KE46203012 MECHANICAL ENGINEERING, KE46403023 HEAVY MACHINERY, KE46203037 HEAVY MACHINERY, KE46203018 PLUMBING. KE46203034 TELECOMMUNICATION.

Mentoring helps to develop a pipeline of future leaders who understand the skills and attitudes required to succeed within the company\/ organization.\nSynergy-Working together collaboratively results in greater accomplishments as compared to each organization working on its own separately.\nSharing resources- When collaborating with other partners, there is always things and resources shared. One company may be an expert in one field and can help the other company learn about it.\nIncreased community awareness-By getting involved with other organizations and groups, our organization\u2019s message is better relayed to the community.\n Access to constituents and funding-Partnering with other organizations can give you the benefit of more grant opportunities as well as make a bridge for more exposure\n","cognitivelink":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/ZIM57BvwA2I","cognitivephotos":"[{ \"title\":\"House construction by PCMF group\",\"comment\":\"Presbyterian Church Men's Fellowship constructing a house for one of the caregivers.

He did his KCSE in 2017. Farming interest was cultivated in him by his parents who were Kales farmers. while in class five he went to watch his favorite program at the neighbor\u2019s but just before the program, a documentary on mushroom farming was aired that he says did all the magic. Leaving that house that evening his mind was thinking of doing not just farming but mushroom farming.\nAfter O levels, Peter for some reason did not want to join college but sought help on starting mushroom farming. He then presented his thoughts to the project management committee (CPC) on attending a three-day seminar at JKUAT on mushroom farming. He was facilitated and went for the training. He got a certificate that helped him secure casual works at various mushroom farms. Though he needed it to support his family and himself, salary did not matter much at that time as much as expanding his skills and knowledge on the same.\nAs his experience in this field grew, his demand also grew. Bigger farms started seeking to contract him. He worked for a particular farm in Ruiru till October this year when the owner expressed interest to sell it off. Peter did not want to let this opportunity slip him but could not imagine working for someone else when he really needed to have his own farm. He therefore approached the owner with interest to buy but remember he didn\u2019t have money at that time. Given that he was her employee, she gave her one week to raise KSH. 500,000 to get the farm. Peter tried all he could to raise the money but good enough he was all along saving his little earnings with DIMKES SACCO in Kiambu. This savings secured him a loan of KSH 200000. He sought top up from other sources and was able to raise the money and now his dream of owning a mushroom farm came true. He named his company TIK TAK MUSHROOMS\nIn a single season, the farm is able to produce a ton of mushrooms sold in sachets of 250g each retailing at KSH 250.\nHis future plans are to take TIK TAK MUSHROOMS to a global level. A level it can compete with other mushroom companies. This is his motivating statement, it doesn\u2019t matter how slow you move provided you don\u2019t stop.\n\n","cognitivelink":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/_vGPUqU41w0","cognitivephotos":"[{ \"title\":\"\",\"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"193.642\",\"name\":\"KE035300421-Germinating%20mushrooms%20in%20the%20beds.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_rt6gwai83fw3xde\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"\",\"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"227.589\",\"name\":\"KE035300421%20the%20mushroom%20farm.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_cuvbwhwg96qw77b\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"\",\"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"208.177\",\"name\":\"KE035300421%20in%20his%20mushroom%20farm.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_egkjta9fnx67s8z\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" }]","cognitivephotos[filecount]":"3","spiritualwriteup":"","spirituallink":"","spiritualphotos":"","spiritualphotos[filecount]":"0","caregiverwriteup":"","caregiverlink":"","caregiverphotos":"","caregiverphotos[filecount]":"0","protectionwriteup":"","protectionlink":"","protectionphotos":"","protectionphotos[filecount]":"0"}},{"255":{"id":"255","submitdate":"2019-05-25 10:41:59","lastpage":"6","startlanguage":"en","seed":"672617200","token":"ke334mwelekaloleni","startdate":"2019-05-24 14:10:22","datestamp":"2019-05-25 10:41:59","physicalwriteup":"","physicallink":"","physicalphotos":"","physicalphotos[filecount]":"0","socialwriteup":"In order to enhance social  and Healthy relationships, the  project has had a number of social activities.

We are aware that adolescence is the pivotal period between childhood and adulthood. It is the time when youth need to acquire the attitudes, competencies, values, and social skills that will carry them forward to successful adulthood. It is also the time when they need to avoid choices and behaviors that will limit their future potential. Just like parents and families, we play a crucial role in helping our teenagers and youths navigate this phase. We have created programs that seek to improve the lives of children and adolescents by meeting their basic physical developmental needs and by helping them to build the competencies needed to become successful adults. Examples of physical development programs we have include involving the youths in community service, organizing mentoring programs for them & giving them the chance to participate in music, and sports.\nJust like the other programs, we have put more emphasis on music and drama especially on modern dance. Through music, children have developed body awareness and many instances music has helped our beneficiaries develop a positive lifelong attitude about staying active and healthy. Through dance, beneficiaries\u2019 imaginations have been sparked and their individual creativity has been nurtured in a unique way. Our beneficiaries represented us in the regional music festivals and were position two in modern dance and choral verse. Besides, Ouma Friday one of the beneficiaries is today playing the piano in the church service, a skill he has acquired in the project \nWe have been active in sports as well and our girls\u2019 junior soccer team have qualified for the regional sports for 2019 editions. We had the best athletes at the cluster level and Martin Joseph consistently emerged the best in 100 and 200 meters junior boys category. In skating our participants dominated the cluster competitions and we have more than ten beneficiaries who will be representing us in the regional competitions\nWe are currently constructing an eight door modern ablution block at a cost of one million (1 Million) that will significantly improve our hygiene and sanitation standards once completed in November 2019.\nCaregivers have also created fifteen cell groups comprising of twenty households per cell group. Twenty leaders elected among the caregivers are working together with the project staff to train each household on basic health standards and preventive approaches in matters to do with health. We started by mapping out the households and conduct survey in regards to health challenges. We are currently emphasizing that each household must have a latrine, a cloth line, dish rack, refuse pit, proper drainage, well maintained & cleared compound as well as a medical cover with NHIF. This approach has helped us to curb many health challenges that hitherto were taking a lot of resources away from many families\n","physicallink":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/45wn5w2ajZ8","physicalphotos":"[{ \"comment\":\"KE0440 relay team awarded the medals after finishing the runners up in the cluster athletics competitions\",\"size\":\"132.921\",\"name\":\"KE0440%20Athletes%20Managed%20First%20Runners%20Up%20Position%20in%20Cluster%20Relay.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_gkdaxq5fmapd3a8\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"comment\":\"Ke0440 junior girls soccer team celebrates with the trophy after winning the cluster competitions.

So we would like to share some of their many stories, knowing you too will come to believe that Deliverance Busia CDC changes lives.\nWaswa's Story: Thriving After Staff Support\nWaswa joined the program when he was in third grade. He was very aggressive, always fighting with his classmates. He demonstrated a high level of anxiety and had the irrational perception that everyone was out to get and blame him for everything. He did not trust anyone. Academically, his grades were poor, below the grade level.\nHe was placed in small classes and occasionally worked with staff on a one-on-one basis, developing a strong relationship with his teachers. During the first year, we saw great improvement in his grades and behavior. He truly thrived in the small class setting and started to enjoy his classes. He also reacted very well to structured routines that were built around blocks of work time and break time. By teaching academics in 20-minute time periods and then having a 10-minute break, Waswa has really been able to focus on his academics.\nHe became involved in activities at school that gave him new ways to express his emotions. Art therapy allowed him to put his feelings down on paper. Art has always been an easier way for him to express himself than using words. He has become a star in art class and this too helped to build his self-esteem.\nThe staff have worked hard to redirect Waswa\u2019s aggressive behavior. He came to know and trust staff, and, when in crisis, he usually ask to see a specific staff members. Staff worked with Waswa to use his words rather than his fists.\nElijah\u2019s Transformed Life\nHe was only eight years old, but Elijah knew what hunger felt like. Neglected by his parents, he was often left alone, with little food and dirty clothes. When Deliverance Busia CDC recruited him to the program, life began to change for Elijah.\nWhen Elijah arrived, he was living with relatives who were trying to help him but finding it very difficult. He did not express affection and was aggressive, yelling and hitting. Sad and scared, tantrums and tears were frequent events. Sometimes he wet himself. Due to significant developmental delays and behavioral issues, he was enrolled in the program.\nAfter enrollment, Elijah adjusted to the classroom routine. For many children, the daily classroom routine is the first time they have ever had a healthy pattern to their day. Elijah was provided with a full battery of services: early childhood education, individual therapy, language therapy and behavioral therapy. As the weeks went by, his therapists and teachers began to see a happier, more successful little boy emerge. He started to actively participate in classroom activities and was a quick learner. His therapist was pleased at the trust he showed in her as she helped him work through his emotional and behavioral issues.\nAfter 13 months, Elijah had achieved the goals set out for him and was above average for his age in cognitive and social\/emotional skills. He had more self-confidence, had become a leader in his class, and is ready to continue with his impressive development in a mainstream primary school program.\nThe success of FCP services is demonstrated in Elijah\u2019s story and the stories of so many children like him.  The program is uniquely qualified to provide the specialized services and evidence-based treatments these traumatized young children need to overcome their horrific experiences.  With the opportunity to heal and grow, young lives like Elijah\u2019s are changed forever and bright new views open up for their futures.\n","sociallink":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/45wn5w2ajZ8","socialphotos":"[{ \"title\":\"KE0440 Group mentorship program\",\"comment\":\" Teenagers having an open forum during a group mentoring program with the project social worker.

Through this training, some of the youths have been able to successfully start small scale bead work item production at home during their free time especially when they are not in school, which in turn has uplifted the living standards of their families economically. With more attention and resource allocation to youth development projects, we are destined to attain greater economic impact on individual beneficiaries and their families\nThe FCP is offering knitting and sewing skills to beneficiaries and survival caregivers in groups of 10. The group of survival mothers have been trained on tailoring & dress making and currently have opened a tailoring shop where they get their daily bread. As a project, we always embolden and empower the group by encouraging them to apply for tenders especially for center and school uniforms available at the project. By so doing, they ultimately stand a chance to grow their business to the next level. \nThe FCP leadership in partnership with the church council has exhibited high level of effective project governance thus enhancing project ownership. The CPCs have been able to carry out intense project activities with a lot of passion and commitment\nEvery year since its establishment, the church leadership has continually demonstrated commitment to the successful implementation of the initiated projects by providing sober, objective leadership, learning from every challenge and properly utilizing every opportunity to make the project a better place to be for all children. It is through this effort that the FCP started and registered a Primary Academy that has since witnessed a steady growth in the number of pupils both from the project and the surrounding community. The quality of education offered has greatly improved as well. The school currently has more than 320 pupils from ECD to class seven\nThe FCP standing in providing education in the community is a testament to our visionary leadership and pioneering informative approach. The results speak for themselves: Our beneficiaries are community assets, their academic test scores have steadily improved; children spend more time actively learning; discipline problems have significantly reduced.\nThe project through good leadership, has managed to establish and successfully run a church-based academy where over 60% of our project beneficiaries come to get instructed on national school curriculum and get quality education. This has become one of the biggest achievement for our center. Currently compassion curriculum is implemented to all learners in the academy while we use Saturday strictly for skills and talent development. The impact of this initiative is that it is influencing all the learners in the academy and beneficiaries\u2019 growth & milestone attainment can now be monitored very closely\nWithin the last three years, we were able to mobilize more than Kes.3M (three million shillings) which has been used to purchase one acre piece of land in Busia town that is currently being used for expanding the academy. This is one of the strategic initiative the FCP is using to make sure that we have sustainability in terms of adequate structures in place such that we significantly reduce dependency on child support fund from CIK\nThe project created an education fund kitty in November 2019 that is intended to help subsidize secondary school fees for our beneficiaries. In the last Compassion Sunday we raised Kes.102,000 that went directly to this kitty. The kitty currently has a fund balance of Kes.218,000 and we have put in place strategies that will enable us to raise & have in the kitty not less than one million Kenya shillings (Kes.1,000,000) by the end of June 2020\nThe FCP leadership has worked hard to secure resources required for successful execution of its core functions in order to achieve the intended results \nThe resource mix at the disposal of the FCP to carry out its work has been evolving, with infrastructural expenditure having risen due to great demand for fundamental facilities. Nonetheless, the FCP found that there are gaps in the funding of key areas. Proposals for raising funds for infrastructural resources targeting agreed outcomes and outputs do not get funded in time and that improvement are needed to ensure that infrastructural funds complement the support funds from the field office to achieve set targets and results\t\nThe leadership of the FCP recommended that a coherent and dynamic resource mobilization strategy should be put in place around impact focus areas that center on the CDC priority frameworks. In connection to this, each parent or caregiver, management committee members and project staff contribute a minimum of Kes.1,000 every financial year to complement support fund. This money is to be channeled into education fund kitty\n\n","cognitivelink":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/45wn5w2ajZ8","cognitivephotos":"[{ \"title\":\"KE0440 beneficiaries making table mats, clutch bags, bracelets, necklaces in their bead work class\",\"comment\":\"Bead work class has produced a lot of hand made products ranging from table mats, necklaces, bracelets, earrings, clutch bags which are sold to parents and church members.

We have established a safety protocol as one of the utmost importance in our youth and children ministry program\nSome of our initiatives include conducting \u201cDinner Meetings\u201d. Church dinner meeting is an annual event hosted by the church for a family service, youth beneficiaries join their peers from other churches for a meal and youth-led discussions. This is an opportunity for our older children to engage in deeper conversation, share life changing moments as they meet children from other churches, and share a meal with those whom they may have not met before.\nOur youths also volunteer at least once a year in different institutions and places. For instance, in 2019 we went to Busia County Referral Hospital, and served in various capacities. Our youths prepared snacks and donations to give to patients at BCRH as they also shared the gospel with patients and hospital staff and it was a humbling experience that all our youth admire to have throughout their journey to adulthood.\nWe have established \u201cHealing Circles\u201d for our beneficiaries. KE0440 conducts healing circles for the purpose of creating a spiritual environment for spiritual awareness, self-healing and transformation for individuals and groups. This program is created for the purpose of assisting beneficiaries to resolve conflict or dispute in a spiritual manner. One in which all parties take spiritual responsibility for their creations and make choices that allow love, peace, freedom, and abundance to again be realized by all. The vision is to evolve relationships and\/or situations to the highest vibration of love and freedom. These self-healing circles have even had magnificent results with participants who have not yet attended.\nWe also have a program called \u201cLive The Way, Live The Truth, Live The Light\u201d that entails looking deeply into oneself, so that one has the opportunity to consciously choose the path of love, peace, joy, freedom and abundance, rather than unconsciously choosing fear, lack and mistrust. This program does not have a great deal of technical teachings. The mind is quieted. The focus is on the heart, soul and spirit. Beneficiaries have the opportunity to work closely with the Holy Ghost and God\u2019s Spirit to guide them. Beneficiaries have the opportunity to transform their lives from one of limitation to one of abundance by tapping the Master within. This spiritual guidance program emphasizes releasing limited beliefs that control experiences by surrendering to knowing self. Through these programs, within a short span of time, we have seen beneficiaries radically alter their behavior and begin choosing to care for themselves and others responsibly. Their relationships with peers and adults in general become more intimate and honest. \nIn addition to the deeper spiritual connection the project works to provide, beneficiaries are also taught practical life skills such as critical & creative thinking, problem solving skills, effective communication, time management, coping with failure, professional etiquette & manners as well as effective decision making. Beneficiaries are trained on piano lessons as well as on how to play brass instruments\nWe have many beneficiaries who have already confessed to us that they don\u2019t want to leave when their time to move on arrives and it is extremely gratifying to hear from them that they are grateful for the experience we\u2019ve provided.\n\n","spirituallink":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/45wn5w2ajZ8","spiritualphotos":"[{ \"title\":\"KE0440 beneficiaries having moments of reflection \",\"comment\":\"The general assembly is the starting point before we go into small age graded groups for different spiritual programs including the healing circles and Live The Way, Live The Truth, Live The Light program\",\"size\":\"7443.914\",\"name\":\"KE0440%20Beneficiaries%20Assembly%20Before%20Heading%20to%20Healing%20Circles.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_hg8dsyvrqcpitnt\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"KE0440 beneficiaries in live the truth program\",\"comment\":\"Live The Way, Live The Truth, Live The Light is a program that allows beneficiaries to have the opportunity to consciously transform their lives\",\"size\":\"7487.764\",\"name\":\"KE0440%20Live%20The%20Way%2C%20Live%20The%20Truth%2C%20Live%20The%20Light%20Sessions.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_r8h33fapn2w86cp\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"KE0440 healing circles program for older beneficiaries\",\"comment\":\"This program is created for the purpose of assisting beneficiaries to resolve conflict or dispute in a spiritual manner\",\"size\":\"7121.4400000000005\",\"name\":\"KE0440%20Healing%20Circles%20Program.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_uc7j7yg7abq9azc\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"KE0440 a group of beneficiaries are taken through piano lessons\",\"comment\":\"Currently Ouma Friday is playing the piano in church and will be competing in piano forte during the soft talent competitions\",\"size\":\"6402.906\",\"name\":\"KE0440%20Piano%20Lessons.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_jp793xpjnffp5k3\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" }]","spiritualphotos[filecount]":"4","caregiverwriteup":"Caregiver engagement is one way in which our FCP has actively pursued in order to carry out our mission of releasing children from all forms of poverty in Jesus name.\nIn support of compassion initiative to reach the wider context of holistic child development, KE0440 Deliverance Busia CDC has sought to train parents and caregivers on basic saving and loaning methodology. Through this activity many families have benefited greatly. This is evident in small scale businesses they run to meet their daily basic needs. The group savings and loaning initiative has brought unity among caregivers\nThe project now enjoys good survival ratio reflected by active participation of parents and the church in program activities.\nSaving and loaning entails saving money in bits so as to enable caregivers to take loans from their support groups. A member is eligible to loan up to three times the total savings. CDWs and CPCs have joined these groups and this has really motivated the parents and caregivers since effective guidance and monitoring is done by the project staff.\nGroup savings and loaning has been in operation, but since November 2018, all the support groups were restructured and proper record keeping was introduced. Currently there are eight active support groups with an average net worth of Kes.400,000 as revolving fund which is increasing overtime due to the interest money borrowed is earning for the group.\nAll the groups are engaged in table banking. Members meet every week to purchase shares and borrow money from their own savings to use in expanding their own businesses. They assist each other to pay the monthly parents contribution of Kes.100 at the project by organizing a merry go round for each member. They have also saved a significant amount of money per group in their savings account. There is no single support group with less than Kes.50,000 as revolving fund. Money that has been raised in the past five months\nThose caregivers who do not own land relied on casual labor which could not sustain them. KE Prosper support group consisting of 15 caregivers leased an acre of farming land for Ksh.5,000 for two seasons which they used to cultivate watermelons as a group in late 2018 and after the harvest were able to reap Kes.150,000 after subtracting all the expenses. They were able to save 20% of the profit, share 40% and the rest has been reinvested back to the second round of watermelon farming. This has made the group make a good economic strides towards eliminating extreme poverty. The local agricultural extension officers help them with good agricultural and technical support. They are also in the process of opening a seedling shop for all farm products and this business will be managed by the group with the guidance and support from the CDWs & management committee members\nCurrently more than fifty caregivers are running profitable businesses which they rely on to meet their daily needs and pay school fees for their children. Each caregiver involved in such businesses gets a profit on average of Ksh.400 per day.  There are caregivers that operate outside catering services, car wash business and cake baking businesses. As an ICP we have offered entrepreneurial skills to help caregivers run their businesses efficiently and profitably\n","caregiverlink":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/45wn5w2ajZ8","caregiverphotos":"[{ \"title\":\"KE0440 Caregiver in her poultry farm \",\"comment\":\"One of the caregivers has been practicing poultry farming.

Her foster parent created partnerships with Mitchel\u2019s teachers to implement strategies that would maximize her learning strengths and compensate for her learning weaknesses.\nShe also has been extremely proactive in bridging the communication gap between Mitchel and her other family members. Her foster parent, with the aid of the project staff, obtained bi-monthly supervised visits between Mitchel and her father: visits that Mitchel has always been looking forward to. \nMitchel\u2019s foster parent has done a remarkable job in strengthening the relationship between Mitchel and her biological family, which has in turn played a major role in Mitchel\u2019s improvement.\nIn reference to the group of learners in the school managed at the FCP, benefit of these children having an outlet in the form of the CDC that advocates for their rights is that they can share their feelings and experiences with a neutral party. This allows them to deal with their emotions or situations appropriately, which in turn helps them to succeed in class. With only half of the children who learn in the school coming from the project, the other half \u2013 comprised of children living in the surrounding community. These children have access to myriad of project services and programs. Some of them may need an alternative set up in regards to the learning needs or a different living environment. The project provides them with more than just the educational services they need. It\u2019s all about giving these children and their families support and an institution they can trust with their issues.\nThe project gives the community children and youth a glimpse of brighter tomorrow. In the neighborhood, a lot of people know of the role the project is playing in changing the life course of many children and youth.\nThe boys and girls who arrive at the project have witnessed more upheaval and difficulties in their lives. They have developed mindsets and behaviors to survive violence, poverty and family dysfunction. And these survival-oriented thoughts and behaviors, unfortunately, have kept children from developing healthy, pro-social ways of thinking and living that ensure success in life beyond survival. Which is where we step in as a project.\nThe idea is for beneficiaries to graduate and move on to less restrictive settings. We do many things by modeling a lifestyle which we hope they will emulate. This includes everything from providing them with an attractive environment which they can learn to take pride in, exposing them to culturally enriching activities such as art festivals and exhibitions to teaching them proper etiquette and allowing them the opportunity to develop their own sense of self-esteem.\nIn addition to the deeper cultural and spiritual connection the project works to provide, we also teach practical life skills such as critical thinking, survival skills, coping with failure, time management, interpersonal relationship, self-awareness, creative thinking, problem solving skills and decision making.\nStatistics show the approach is working. The proof of the success is in the number of learners who were struggling in their academics and now have improved significantly, families that were dysfunctional and broken reunited, children living in less restrictive settings or on to independent living and we have the resolve to continue advocating for the project children as well as children from the community.\n","protectionlink":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/45wn5w2ajZ8","protectionphotos":"[{ \"title\":\"KE0440 Shanel Shantel supported by her teacher Winnie Asili on first aid training\",\"comment\":\"Shanel Shantel demonstrate how to respond to emergency and basic first aid tips\",\"size\":\"6387.222\",\"name\":\"KE0440%20Shanel%20Shantel%20Training%20her%20Peers%20In%20First%20Aid.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_97hv56bzhzb3adf\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"KE0440 beneficiaries taken through life skills training\",\"comment\":\"Recho Lishundu one of the beneficiaries helps in training other children on life skill lesson\",\"size\":\"7181.508\",\"name\":\"KE0440%20Recho%20Lishundu%20in%20Life%20Skill%20Training%20Session.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_j45b32564aq6ue9\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" }]","protectionphotos[filecount]":"2"}},{"283":{"id":"283","submitdate":"2019-05-28 14:43:07","lastpage":"6","startlanguage":"en","seed":"1276317244","token":"ke528dandoracdc","startdate":"2019-05-27 14:12:42","datestamp":"2019-05-28 14:43:07","physicalwriteup":"FAVOUR UNBOUNDED\nVICTORS AKUMU\u2019S INCREDIBLE STORY\nVictor Akumu was enrolled in the project in the year 2002 aged 6 years.

He\/She knew exactly what that means. I have personally come to believe, change does not begin with being rich, and having lots of money, power or influence, but it begins with a changed mindset. In 2017 January, the gospel of Knowing, Loving and Protecting a Child was so strange in the ears of many people in Buguta Community, because they believed in their tradition way of life. They strongly believed children are property to be owned and controlled as one wishes. A girl child was \u201cwealth\u201d and a boy child was only to watch the material \u201cwealth\u201d. They were not allowed to exercise their rights of participating in decision making, expressing themselves, freedom e.t.c. Today! Things have changed for the better! Glory to God! Child Protection is now a sweet music and great initiative of many in Buguta! Through many frequent child protection training to caregivers and awareness programs, reality has started bowing down to the power of information, by and by, a positive change is being noticeable in the lives of children and families.                                          \n\nOPERATION PELEKA WATOTO SHULE\nThe changed mindset of the caregivers led to the birth of this great program we call \u201cOPERATION PELEKA WATOTO SHULE,\u201d which has continued to get stronger and stronger. In a population of 256 beneficiaries, only two are not enrolled in school because of their age. Through this program, 196 caregivers have now opened fixed bank accounts for their children and are now depositing money for their children future education. After every 3 months, KCB Bank, comes to the project site to sort out all accounting matters with the parents. We call it KCB Day. As upto now, most caregivers (over 20 caregivers so far) have managed to save more than Kshs. 5,000 for their children!\t\t\t\t\n\nUREMBO ETERNITY GROUP\nApart from the Awarding strategy, caregivers themselves formed two groups under one umbrella name called Urembo Eternity Group. This income generating group was purposely formed to help the caregivers acquire knowledge that would help them raise more funds for their children education. The caregivers were trained on how to make accessories and African baskets (Viondo\/Vidasi). Today, they make good selling out of their products and the office helps them to deposit the money in their children fixed education accounts. So far we have deposited Kshs. 30,000 in education accounts from Viondo group and Kshs. 4,000 from the Accessories group. Isn\u2019t this amazing? \n\nYes, they are poor! Yes, they don\u2019t have much! But Information has changed their mindset! Their zeal to eradicate poverty with the little they get gives us strength everyday of wanting to walk with them this journey of going to a better life! \tBy and by, we are moving from one glory to another.

As a church partner we endeavor towards producing beneficiaries who are well equipped with skills that can enable them to be economically independent. Some few years ago we embarked on a journey to mentor beneficiaries by helping them identify, nurture and develop their talents and skills. Mentorship in our context means giving the beneficiaries an opportunity to; try, make mistakes, rectify, improve and perfect. Skills and talents cultivation is in tandem with the cognitive desired outcome \u201cExhibits the motivation and skills to be economically self-supporting\u201d Also it gives our youths a competitive hand in the wake of unemployment levels.\nKE090600046 James Muriithi and KE090600295 Jane Wairimu are some our youths who are positively responding to our mentorship with promising chances of bearing sweet fruits. \nJames is an upcoming photographer as well as a video recorder and editor. We identified his urge and decided to enroll him in the program. He started with taking photos during the birthday party, sports and soft talent events as well as the caregivers meetings and trainings. He has sharpened his skills through the motivation, encouragement, coaching form the church partner workers.  Since he completed his secondary school education he has been moving with like-minded people in the community events such as weddings, dowry ceremonies, etc where he continues to harness and sharpen his skills. He is earning a few pennies with a hope of making more with time. Never the less he is languishing with the lack of cameras that befits the technological advancements of the day. Given more platform he will someday become the best photographer and video editor.\nJane is a promising footballer with a greater potential to play at international levels. She started playing at the project at the beginner level and scaled through the levels. She now plays for the project senior girls\u2019 team, a trainer for the junior team, and community team player. She has successfully played at her secondary schools with outstanding performance. She has competitively engaged in the community leagues organized by the area MP and MCA. She has obtained awards that have been beneficial to her. Now that she has completed her secondary schools she hopes to join a talent academy to continue sharpening her skills.\nThese two are just but a representative of the many beneficiaries who have benefited immensely from the mentorship program that has enabled them to realize their full potential as well as boosting their self-esteem.  It is fundamental to help the beneficiaries utilize their God given abilities in becoming economically independent.\n\n\n","cognitivelink":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/KymAFPepIU0","cognitivephotos":"[{ \"title\":\"\",\"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"2501.506\",\"name\":\"KE0906%20Youth%20with%20Junior%20girls%20soccer%20team.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_2qzyi7iw5tukaym\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"\",\"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"118.533\",\"name\":\"KE906%20Youth%20coaching%20junior%20girls%20soccer%20team.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_vngsyyfay3ih4qc\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"\",\"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"2441.214\",\"name\":\"KE906%20Youth%20taking%20photos.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_shspynhjuxwyqpd\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"\",\"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"6466.197\",\"name\":\"KE906%20Youth%20Editting%20videos%20%281%29.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_8pbpfjtdv3gefcm\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"\",\"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"6609.017\",\"name\":\"KE906%20Youth%20taking%20video.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_yrq4reksh232xb5\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" }]","cognitivephotos[filecount]":"5","spiritualwriteup":"","spirituallink":"","spiritualphotos":"","spiritualphotos[filecount]":"0","caregiverwriteup":"","caregiverlink":"","caregiverphotos":"","caregiverphotos[filecount]":"0","protectionwriteup":"","protectionlink":"","protectionphotos":"","protectionphotos[filecount]":"0"}},{"303":{"id":"303","submitdate":"2019-05-28 13:13:10","lastpage":"6","startlanguage":"en","seed":"617980606","token":"ke814acksimenyacdc","startdate":"2019-05-28 12:30:30","datestamp":"2019-05-28 13:13:10","physicalwriteup":"Shelter has been a real problem in Simenya community. The project has networked with organizations such as give direct to support caregivers acquire basic shelters for their households. This effort has born limited fruits as only three beneficiaries were reached. In addition, a huge  number of beneficiaries were never reached. The changing climatic conditions of the area aggravated the shelter need. The numerous grass thatched houses continued to deteriorate exposing the beneficiaries to increased danger. This need has also resulted into increased illness among the affected beneficiary. Illnesses such as cold, cough, chest problems and other Upper Track Related infections remained high among these beneficiaries.  This intern raises the treatment cost of these beneficiaries.\n\nThe fact that the poor living conditions of these caregivers has inhabited their capacity to raise basic shelter for their family members. In addition, 70 % of the caregivers were either widowers or widows. The traditions around the shelter renovations contributed to their incapacitated them from renovating their own shelters. The church has been on the forefront in supporting the initiative. The church in their attempt to reach out to the needy supported beneficiary no 249 raise a basic shelter after their shelter was blown away by the heavy rains.The church's limited financial capacity has hindered their ability to reach more beneficiaries.  The F.C.P raised a 6 million proposal that has benefited 60 beneficiaries. The money was divided among 3 Front-line Church Partners (F.C. P) (821,812  814 respectively). \n\nIn 814 the initiative was implemented in 2019 with the beneficiaries being, 360,3005,508,426, 471, 358\/359, 278.97,190,107,207,385,471,402, 385,434,44,495,208 and 170. These beneficiaries had either fallen houses or existing poor and dilapidated shelters. Their leaking and cracked nature exposed the beneficiaries to high risk of the houses falling on them. The initiative rescued some beneficiaries such as 208 from family strife  and conflict that almost caused harm to the family. Other families such as 358 moved into the new house before it was completed due to being homeless at the onset of the heavy rains in 2019 . \n\nThe joys of these families continue to remain unexpressed as they explain how this project has impacted them. Their responses on the impact of the initiative is captured in the 3 minute video whose link is provided below. This is a permanent impact in their lives and its story will be told to generations to come. Many has termed it an expected miracle that has released them from shame. In luo they express it as ''Umo leke' which is directly translated as release from the enemies mockery and laughter.They have immensely appreciate the move to release them from the unspeakable poverty.

The zones include: simenya, Ndere, Rangala. Alego and Yiro. In addition other sub-groups also emerged per zone when a group attained a maximum membership of 20 participants. This has resulted into the emergence of 14 groups with a total membership at 143. The minimum share per group is at 100 shilling per sitting. The number of meetings ranges from 1 to 2 per month. The members elect and demote leaders based on the constitution. Currently the share capital is at ksh. 270,000 with a loan capacity of ksh. 340,000. \n\nThis initiative has enabled members to initiate small scale businesses for their own upkeep.In addition this initiative has supported caregivers in the process of renovating their poor and dilapidated houses. The caregivers raised their share level and were able to acquire material such as round poles, fitos and unskilled labor. These were valuated at kes. 22,150\/= per household. The 20 beneficiaries of house renovation raised ksh. 443,000 as local contribution with ease. Group members also offered any needed support to the 94 direct and indirect beneficiaries.\n\nMoreover, the zonal representatives together with the caregivers identified poor shelter and prioritized them per zone and forwarded the list to the Accountability committee for further follow up and verification.

This makes our 214 primary school going beneficiaries in our church-based private primary school. We have been training our beneficiaries on playing musical instruments and holding open air crusades that supported youths led.\nWe have been working closely with Global Youth Ministries in training all clergy servants and respective Sunday school teachers from which our beneficiaries attends either Sunday school or church service.

Global Youth Ministry has chosen us to be the Eastern Region learning and teaching materials centre of distribution. We have a church that we are coaching on Children Ministry by the name Africa Inland Church Kathamba and we have distributed freely issued teaching and learning booklets to over 80 FCPs within the Country for the last one year. Global Youth Ministry personnel normally trains our beneficiaries on quarterly basis in various levels such as puppet ministry, momentum booklets levels 1 to 4 and Kuza App. This has made our beneficiaries know Gospel and has made a profession of faith appropriate of the universal Gospel of Christ.  \nOur registered beneficiaries are actively and passionately practicing spiritual disciplines of prayer, Bible study, worship and study. This is vividly portrayed by the way our 214 beneficiaries conducts themselves before they start their studies at our church-based private primary school, they voluntarily conduct morning devotions and prayers before any lesson commences. We do not have Saturday programs since we normally implement curriculum on Tuesdays and Thursdays, our youths spares two hours on Saturdays to do community service especially door to door evangelism.\nOne of our stationery suppliers freely donated Bibles to the 15 Survival mothers who have really benefited from them. \nWe commenced a Sunday school feeding program since as a church we are blessed to have most of resources such as a modern kitchen, piped water, utensils etc and the church members contributes porridge flour.

A state that contributes heavily on high rates of poverty. \n\nAnti social problem was observed at the initial stage. Many of the people could not sit together for serious discussions. They only like coming together during out dated cultures like bull fighting.\n\nBecause of high illiteracy level, many could not come to a common understanding during various discussions. The social problem married the community.\nWe have high rates of school dropouts in the villages. This is due to lack of money to pay part of school levies as required even the CDC and the government have paid their part. \nThe usefulness of the intervention is as follows:\n We have permanent structures for pig rearing for beneficiaries. They are durable and easy to clean. The beneficiaries and caregivers who benefited from this intervention are happy and see a bright future. \nEconomic empowerment has been realized to the beneficiaries. This is following the delivery of piglets which are being sold for beneficiaries up keep. The amount realized from the sales of piglets is able to be used to purchase food, clothing and fees for the brothers and sisters in the family. The greatest benefit is to have society that is set free from poverty in the near future.\nThe health of the beneficiaries has greatly improved following the family being able to get some money from the sales of pig lets and feeding on balanced deity. This reduces disease incidents. \nThe spirit of sharing among others is felt because some of the piglets are being passed to other caregivers. This has also increased the social life of the community due sharing of even information and coming together in groups and learn pig farming management.\nThe beneficiaries have learnt how to save money in preparation for purchase feeds of the pigs. They have come up with groups where they meet in different days and contribute money for saving. This will make the beneficiaries be self reliance. The first group of 11 members have registered and opened bank account in which they have deposited Ksh.13500.\nThe trainings undertaken have equipped many beneficiaries and caregivers with pig rearing knowledge and methods.  They are promising to put more effort in pig farming. This has reduced idleness among the group members. \n74 Piglets have been furrowed of which 38 have been given to other caregivers making the number of caregivers in pig farming to be 49.

There are very minimal child abuse. Beneficiaries share with teachers cases that they feel that they are not right them. School dropout are minimal.\nWe also talk to the caregivers about children's rights and child protection in all the forums we organize for them at the centre. This has reduced abuse incidents in the community.\nLastly the beneficiaries appreciated  for the well spent day and they learned a lot.\n\n","protectionlink":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/fe7CagbN_BY","protectionphotos":"[{ \"title\":\"Child protection awareness to the public\",\"comment\":\"KE0420 - Beneficiaries and Teachers walk in the community with posters written children's rights and the related information.\",\"size\":\"3099.859\",\"name\":\"KE0420%20Beneficiaries%20preparing%20to%20walk.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_p6569nq54zdke6c\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"Child protection awareness to the public\",\"comment\":\"KE0420 - Beneficiaries and Teachers walk in the community with posters written children's rights and the related information.\",\"size\":\"2831.087\",\"name\":\"KE0420%20Beneficiaries%20walking%20to%20market.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_dcdzxhz82ck7wvf\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"Child protection awareness to the public\",\"comment\":\"KE0420 - Beneficiaries and Teachers walk in the community with posters written children's rights and the related information.\",\"size\":\"2964.51\",\"name\":\"KE0420%20Teachers%20walked%20to%20market.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_fn5vikms93fbtup\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"Child Protection\",\"comment\":\"KE420 Beneficiaries getting ready to wal\",\"size\":\"2972.294\",\"name\":\"KE420%20Beneficiaries%20getting%20ready%20to%20walk.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_f3fanzu4arr4fai\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" }]","protectionphotos[filecount]":"4"}},{"315":{"id":"315","submitdate":"2019-06-06 19:52:49","lastpage":"6","startlanguage":"en","seed":"730883024","token":"ke605fgckndungiricdc","startdate":"2019-05-29 07:06:21","datestamp":"2019-06-06 19:52:49","physicalwriteup":"We did not have a pianist for a long period of time.

were very cooperative and dedicated.On Fridays the beneficiaries were meeting without their teacher to practice on what they had learnt over the week.The program went on until on the 14th February when they decided that they will be coming a early to bake their own cakes for sale on their way home and while at home at least to raise money for buying the daily requirements for training rather than borrowing from their caregivers always.\n\nThe deal started immediately where they were coming to the project even on Mondays to bake for business purposes.Training went on very well since they could provide the training requirements by themselves and adequately.The business part of it grew well and were receiving orders for cakes even from shops at a wholesale price.The children and teachers from the nearby school too were buying cakes queen cakes and donuts from them too.The training ended on the 20th of March,2019 and the youth felt fully equipped with the basic skills.By this time the beneficiaries had saved a total of 7000\/= profit and their plan was to buy an oven worthy 10500\/= to do their own business independently,the project supported them and they were bought the oven.\n\nSince then they have been baking cakes for birthdays,weddings and other celebrations requiring cake cutting.Their plan is to open a joint account,save together,register their business and do a more bigger business.They are currently very supportive to themselves in terms of provision of some of the basic personal items.Their families too are appreciating their

This project was established in 2007 in response to the intense poverty evident in the community. Poverty in this region is highly attributed to illiteracy, food scarcity, unemployment, high prevalence HIV\/Aids, poor infrastructure, unemployment and evident pressure on land. This translates to intense poverty and economic difficulties both at the community and at household level of majority families in this area. This condition is also replicated in the Churches where these people \u00a0commune.\nAs a result of increasing levels of poverty, the parents and caregivers are unable to construct reasonable shelters for their inhabitation. Within her financial abilities, the Church has managed to provide basic facilities like the office, few classrooms, Church hall and playing grounds, sanitation block and human resource within the project premises but unable to extend this to individual homes. Good living conditions will go a long way in reduction of treatment costs, prevention of diseases and even raising self esteem of family members raising the standard of living. Registered children will also be able to concentrate on academics and spiritual growth. \nAmbira Child Development Center parents and caregivers face many challenges meeting public health standards on hygiene, safety and prevention of communicable diseases due to lack of a proper shelter for protection of bad weather conditions, proper food preparation & eating area and sleeping facilities. Registered children families currently live in very poor security and unhealthy conditions exposing them to risk of contracting communicable disease and eating contaminated food. Several cases of jigger infections have been reported and handled though reoccurrences are very common on the same cases handle due to poor shelter conditions. Some families are rained on during rainy days forcing them to stay awake whole night in case it rains at night. Others absent themselves from school or don\u2019t participate actively in school and program activities due to bad effects of rain. Some of these affected families live with chronic illness cases exposing them more to opportunistic infections. These infections may result in deaths if not intervened in good time.\nThe ICP has had a challenge with high cost of treatments mostly from communicable diseases like Malaria, diarrhea, and Typhoid. The renovations of these houses will help reduce hygiene related infections hence reduce cost of treatments among registered children. \nPoor academic performance is directly linked with poor living conditions. Registered children are unable to study and do their homework at home due to hash weather conditions in the dilapidated houses. Self-esteem of the registered children has been lowered to the extent of loss of confidence even in class work. Children often compare themselves with others in their locality and this seriously affects their esteem negatively impacting on their academic performance. Renovation of these shelters will improve academic standards by allowing children to have good study environment and raise their self-esteem gaining confidence in themselves.\n","protectionlink":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/LggxCjEbbG8","protectionphotos":"[{ \"title\":\"KE082100353 FABIAN.\",\"comment\":\"This was fabians residence before construction\",\"size\":\"1709.087\",\"name\":\"KE082100353%20FABIAN.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_2tnn9mfc8u97b86\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"KE082100353 FABIAN (Complete house).JPG\",\"comment\":\"Completed 3 roomed  house for Fabians family which they have happily inhibited\",\"size\":\"2602.913\",\"name\":\"KE082100353%20FABIAN%20%28Complete%20house%29.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_vuzman2ihdwbg53\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"KE082100242 BEFORE CONSTRUCTION.JPG\",\"comment\":\"this house was occupied by 8 people including Zilpa and her other teen age siblings.

In future I am convicted that they will be computer wizards who are excellent in various operations. During program days they are always yearning for the lessons. They can perform arithmetic, identify images, read and also increased language level.\n\nThis initiative has been a success after the Resource Centre was constructed in the year 2014. It is a bee hive of activities as part of it we have a library which assist the youth ascend the scholastic ladder. Another section it has a room that conducts photocopying services that is an IGA. The final section has computers and Saturdays beneficiaries flock to utilize the computers.\n\nDuring week days it is a computer college where residents in the surrounding learn various packages. The Lab too has helped in implementing the YDS Curriculum as EX form four candidates learn computer packages deeply and on completion they are awarded with certificates. This builds up their resumes and it is an element nowadays that it is required for almost every employment.\n\nIt is the believe of our heart that in future we will provide computer engineers who will revolutionize the entire globe.\n","sociallink":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=p-820uCEI4Q","socialphotos":"[{ \"title\":\"\",\"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"2041.599\",\"name\":\"DSC08086.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_ytm2juizd82dxv9\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"\",\"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"1571.059\",\"name\":\"DSC08082.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_a6bmxwhchcmd7zy\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"\",\"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"1235.229\",\"name\":\"DSC08078.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_pakt4p7jquzegxj\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" }]","socialphotos[filecount]":"3","cognitivewriteup":"","cognitivelink":"","cognitivephotos":"","cognitivephotos[filecount]":"0","spiritualwriteup":"","spirituallink":"","spiritualphotos":"","spiritualphotos[filecount]":"0","caregiverwriteup":"","caregiverlink":"","caregiverphotos":"","caregiverphotos[filecount]":"0","protectionwriteup":"","protectionlink":"","protectionphotos":"","protectionphotos[filecount]":"0"}},{"373":{"id":"373","submitdate":"2019-05-31 14:28:20","lastpage":"6","startlanguage":"en","seed":"1393546768","token":"ke455fpfkaturetcdc","startdate":"2019-05-31 10:22:06","datestamp":"2019-05-31 14:28:20","physicalwriteup":"The initiative started in 2014 January with a caregivers meeting where the FCP was mapping the strengths and the weeks for the soul purpose is looking for the solutions to the major challenges facing the area.

During these years the brain undergoes its most dramatic growth, setting the stage for social and emotional development. Language blossoms, basic motor abilities form, thinking becomes more complex, and children begin to understand their own feelings and those of others.\nTo achieve the social development outcome, it was first put clear in the mind of the clients and the caregiver that social development refers to the process by which a child learns to interact with others around them. As they develop and perceive their own individuality within their community. Therefore, the children have constantly been trained on developing skills to communicate with other people and process their actions through development of healthy development friendships and other relationships, as well handling conflicts with their peers within the project and without it.\nIt is through this understanding that participatory activities among them are the choir competitions which the project has been participating in. The children have developed good skills in set pieces under the own competition cadre. Last year\u2019s competitions the team of 33 children were able to reach the regional level and became position 2. \nThe FCP had 12 items presented to the cluster competitions and this was an improvement from the previous 6 items sent for competitions. Among the items presented, the folk songs, singing game, the set piece and the dram set were able to proceed to the regional levels. Reaching the regional levels of the competitions made the children developing a need to be trained always in the project hence changing the program timetable. It is now mandatory that the children are trained for choir every program day between 2:00 PM to 3:30 pm.\nThe children have also been interviewed in radio Elishama in Uganda over achievement in the choir and poems in which one child ke045500095 Davine Isuat was anchored live in the month of May 2018. This made the team from the Elishama radio begin to teach the children in the project on the vocals, Journalism, Piano, guitar, Saxophone, and drum set skills. In the month of August 2018 and December 2018.

On 03\/04\/2018 the child bought a 2 sheep and on 17\/07\/2018 he bought another calf. On 09\/04\/2019 the child bought sheep. This makes the child own 5 cows and 4 sheep by now. Looking at this income the child will have no problem with school fees when she gets to high school bearing in mind that she is now in standard 5.\nKe045500246 Meshack Masinde also started his journey to reaches on 25\/04\/2017 when he walked home ffrom the market with 3 cows and on 25\/07\/2017 he added a goat and on 26\/06\/2018 he bought another calf and a goat.

Before then, the care givers were not able to support themselves with their families through provision of basic needs for their families. KE 455 FPFK Aturet CDC has brought the idea of group savings and loaning initiative for the care givers to participate in and do table banking as well in order to make them to be self-supportive to themselves and their families. Similarly, this has helped the care givers to practice saving culture helping them to save and budget for their family future needs. Currently, most of our care givers are committed in group meetings making them stay away from idleness which is the devils mind workshop. Currently the ICP has 10 groups which are active and the groups have a minimum finance base of Kshs. 108,000. The Machakusi group has already developed they meet every Monday of the week. Apart from loaning they also have preaching and providing advice to the members on the development. Most of the member of the group has ventured into the money exchange program and other are textile sellers and others are cereal sellers. This has opened the member\u2019s eyes and no they grew from being idle to businessmen and women. \nFrom the initiative many caregivers have managed to solve problems in their own homes, provide basic needs and build houses.  KE 455 has enabled the care givers to engage in food crop production as an avenue for reducing poverty level among them and improving their ways of living. This has also enabled them to participate in their monthly contribution and ensure a positive development of the ICP. To date, majority of the care givers are able to sustain their families through small scale farming. \nThe cow peas project every year provide a turnover of approximate 300,000 to the caregivers. The initiative started in the 2014 with only 30 farmers being supported with seed lings. The seed multiplication formula was developed where the 30 caregivers returned double the issued kilograms of the seed and by now all the caregivers have the seed which is being planted in the months of June and July and its being harvested in the month of November each year. This has led to the speed in the engagement of the caregivers in supporting the structural development in the CDC\n","caregiverlink":"","caregiverphotos":"[{ \"title\":\"ke045500262 Pauline Emodo's grandmother feeding her 50 guinea fawls \",\"comment\":\"The initiative started in 2018 with only 10 fawls.

initiative here is a a story by a beneficiary by the name Geoffrey Kaloki which comes from a family of 5 members who are mother, 3 boys and a girl. The father deserted the family and later died in the year 2017. This beneficiary was receiving gifts since January 2015 when he received a gift and bought the first goat. The family did not have a single goat then and were sleeping on the floor and sometimes going without food. The family had constructed a grass thatched house at the mother\u2019s home after being chased away from the beneficiary father\u2019s home. The first gift enabled them to buy a bed, mattress, blanket and a she goat which have helped transform the life of the family. In Nov. 2015 the beneficiary received a large gift and were able to purchase 5 goats, a table and a plastic chair. In 2016 Nov. the beneficiary received another large gift and purchased 8 pcs iron sheets, and 3 more chairs. The goats started reproducing and by Nov. 2017 the family had 12 goats all  as a result of birthday or family gifts from Charles brown, the beneficiary\u2019s supporter. The family really enjoyed but to make the matter worse they faced another challenge of feeding these goats. They had nowhere to graze these goats. To address the problems in the family, the mother sourced for a piece of land at their neighbors and a Good Samaritan promised to sell 1 acre to the family. The mother informed the church leadership on this and requested to be helped to sell the goats so as to boost in purchasing this piece of land and sort the issue of grazing. We sold 11 goats and the family remained with only one goat. We managed to raise KSh. 32,000 which boosted the family in purchasing the 1 acre of land. The family is very happy to own their land.

This oven uses direct sunlight. This particular oven caught the attention of the beneficiaries and about 60% of them got interested in baking as a skill.\nSince, a lot of parents don\u2019t have time to teach their children how to bake, we at KE0762, thought it would be cool to teach our beneficiaries this skill. Baking is a skill that requires a lot of thinking step by step and following the specifics of the here and now. It\u2019s also thinking about recipes, the baking dish as a whole and what you are going to do with it. It\u2019s really a good way of developing that balance of the moment and the bigger picture and I suppose that is why a lot of our beneficiaries are into it. This is a skill that can enable beneficiaries raise some little income even after successfully exiting the program.\nBringing the beneficiaries on board for this skill was not a challenge, since everyone wanted to interact with the unique oven and of course children love cakes.\nOne of the major impact is that, during the sunny days, instead of buying the birthday cakes, with the provision of the ingredients, the beneficiaries are able to bake cakes for the celebrations. The beneficiaries are now intending to start baking for sell for the community at a cheaper cost when they have families celebrations. Some of them, like the girl giving the testimony in the video, are able to bake at home and sell them in small pieces at ksh.5 each once the caregiver provides the ingredients. This is a great achievement to us as an Fcp and we are seriously working towards encouraging beneficiaries to engage in various skill.\nThis far, we thank God for he\u2019s been our Ebeneezer and hence we give him all the glory and honor.\nGod bless Kijipwa CDC beneficiaries, staff and the management for their sacrificial commitment and support towards the children ministry.\n\nPROJECT DIRECTOR\nPHOEBE A.

As our slogan states \u201cDeliverance Church Nakuru \u2013 home of champions\u201d we have won trophies at different levels of competitions over the years. At the cluster level other teams will always endeavor to outdo KE 357 teams. Our senior girl\u2019s football team has managed to proceed to the national level for 5 consecutive years and have been the national winners for the past 3 years. Our senior boy\u2019s football has managed position one at the cluster level for six years with an exception of one year only. \nOur volley ball teams both girls and boys have won at the cluster level, regional level and proceeded to the national level from 2012 to date with an exception of 2015 when the boys did not proceed to the national level only. All this can be witnessed by the many trophies we have won indeed it is our hall of fame. Coleta Awuor KE035700285 has been awarded as the best player twice. \nWinning is not obvious. There has been a lot of effort from the beneficiaries, coaches and CDW\u2019s all together. We always take sports as a continuous activity we do not do it as a one time activity. Practices happen throughout the year. Any time there is a national holiday the players will always be in the field practicing. Most of the team players are also engaged in local team and we are trusting God to give them opportunities at the regional and national teams. Most of the coaching is usually done by the beneficiaries themselves who act as a great motivation among the rest of the beneficiaries. \nIn April 2019 the cluster sports competitions were held and our senior football boys, senior football girls, volleyball girls and boys won and will be proceeding at the regional level except for senior boys which will proceed as a select team. The junior boys took position two. \nThe sporting activities have impacted the beneficiaries in various ways some of them being:-\n\u2022\tHealthy interactions among the beneficiaries\n\u2022\tSome have taken the sport as a profession and are slowly advancing in growing their talents in various clubs.\n\u2022\tCreated a harmony between the beneficiaries who live as one big family\n\u2022\tSponsorship in various schools which has made them be disciplined and shouldering of some of fees gives others opportunities to share more. \nWe give God all the glory for great victories over time. We recognize that it is Him who gives us victory. The teams are always presented to the pastoral team for prayers before competitions and are keen to give a sacrifice of thanksgiving after every victory. \nKeeping the environment clean is key and the beneficiaries occasionally take time to clean the church compound so that they can. \n\nThe beneficiaries have been taught how to give back to the community and to serve others.  There has been a great desire to do outreaches and support other children and youth who may be challenged in one way or another. The beneficiaries have reached out to the surrounding community with a desire to touch their lives.\n","sociallink":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/0YFl-gUxmjk","socialphotos":"[{ \"title\":\"KE0357 SENIOR GIRLS FOOTBALL TEAM\",\"comment\":\"PRESENTING TROPHY TO PATRON AND PRAYER TO PROCEED TO THE NATIONALS\",\"size\":\"429.604\",\"name\":\"KE357%20SENIOR%20GIRLS%20TEAM-%20PRAYER%20FOR%20THE%20TEAM.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_yt2zdu3bihvbfx9\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"KE0357 VOLLEYBALL GIRLS TEAM\",\"comment\":\"DURING CLUSTER COMPETITIONS\",\"size\":\"884.025\",\"name\":\"KE0357%20VOLLEYBALL%20GIRLS%20TEAM%20-%20CLUSTER%20COMPETITIONS.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_zwpy25n8b8vmmfh\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"KE0357 TROPHIES\",\"comment\":\"OUR HALL OF FAME\",\"size\":\"950.665\",\"name\":\"KE0357%20HALL%20OF%20FAME.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_rtkraptsimhu4p8\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"KE0357 VOLLEYBALL TEAM\",\"comment\":\"PRESENTING TROPHY TO PATRON AND PRAYER TO PROCEED TO THE NEXT LEVEL\",\"size\":\"389.195\",\"name\":\"KE0357%20VOLLEYBALL%20BOYS%20PRESENTING%20TROPHY%20TO%20PATRON%20AND%20PRAYERS.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_vmhyqn7eanzwsh6\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"KE035700285\",\"comment\":\"AWARDED BEST PRAYER\",\"size\":\"916.945\",\"name\":\"KE0357%2000285%20.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_5zxn2hmm9w6kfrs\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" }]","socialphotos[filecount]":"5","cognitivewriteup":"","cognitivelink":"","cognitivephotos":"","cognitivephotos[filecount]":"0","spiritualwriteup":"Every program day begins with a powerful service\/devotion in various age groups.

They are the brains behind the whole video generation with the inputs of Lemmy Ofula KE041400699 who did the recording.\nThe fact that Harriet has been in a position to meet her personal needs at the college with proceeds from her exploits in Agriculture has been a motivation to the other youth who believe they can make in life by acquiring skills in the numerous vocational training we take them through. The good work shown by Harriet is as a result of the insights given by one KE041400686 Peter Anangwe who is pursuing a Diploma course in applied Biology he inspires the team a lot on current research materials and information.\nFinally, Ke041400678 Agneta Seka is an example of finishing well.

This has not been easy for the various the parents\/ caregivers. The support of the church has helped these needy beneficiaries to access education to various levels.\nThe beneficiaries sponsored within our project are the neediest of the neediest, the parents\/ caregivers are low income earners and they cannot afford to cater for their educational needs. This normally affects the learning process, particularly for bright beneficiaries who are in and out of class and the average beneficiary who needs consistency in class attendance. \nThis initiative involved paying of school fees for beneficiaries to enable them attend school and colleges in order to acquire knowledge and skills for economic self-reliance.\nBelow are stories of some beneficiaries who have benefited from this initiative.\nKE041200770 IAN MUSHILIMA OMINDE\nIan was recruited at the age of 6 years when he was in nursery school. Since Ian came from a poor family, his parents couldn't afford to pay for his education. The project took an initiative of paying school fees for him from nursery level. Through this, Ian was able to complete his primary level of education, he went to secondary school which he also completed successfully. This enabled him to join a Technical training institute where he is currently pursuing a Certificate in Social work and Community Development which he will be completing in August this year. Ian confesses that if it wasn't for the project he would not have reached this far.\n\nKE041200921 COLLINS KUSINJIRU\nAt the age of 6 years, Collins was recruited at Burendwa Child Development Centre. Having been born in a family of six children with the pressure of providing for the family, Collins did not see any future hope. But thanks be to God because when he was recruited, Collins was able to join nursery school to start his educational journey. The project provided for him the needed items & even paid the required school levies to enable him continue with his education. Collins continued his primary education which he completed and joined secondary school.  Life in secondary school turned to be a challenge to Collins due to indiscipline. Collins underwent several guiding & counselling sessions to help him but this yielded little. Eventually Collins dropped out of school. As a project, we did not give up on him. We continued to give him psycho-social support which yielded fruit. Collins accepted to join a driving school for driving lessons. He completed the training and now he is preparing to join an automative mechanics training. Had it not been for the project Collins admits that he would not have achieved this.\nOther beneficiaries who have benefitted through the initiative include KE041200782 Cynthia Isichi Khakali who was able to join Butere Girls High School for her secondary education, KE041200988 Dorothy Grace Shitote who is currently in form 3 at Lugulu Girls High School.

STORY OF KE 435 CAREGIVERS EMPOWERMENT.\n\nACK mayenje cdc was started in 2013. The caregivers were not financial empowered by then, this was evident with the kind of livelihood in the community. Through training like baking, soap making, table banking, brick making among others on economic empowerment, the caregivers slowly but steadily saw the light of day.\nTable baking has taken the lead in KE435. Through this initiative, caregivers are able to make savings, borrow loans and access grants from government institutions. Started in 2016, the project has about 12 registered caregivers groups with membership of 20-30. The money they obtain from this group is able to sustain their businesses and families, their livelihood has transformed from people who depended on hand out to people who give out to others, as a matter of fact some groups have come in handy in helping other members of the community in training about this great initiative,\nThis video showcases some of the success story brought about with the table banking initiative and other trainings on caregiver empowerment. Stella who is a single mother to child KE4350294 Purity Were, is an example in the video, out of the savings from the group, she was able to purchase a piece of land where she intends to build a house for her family and one for her chicken. Juliet and Justine have combined forces to making bricks from the money the save and loan from their group. Sarah has also benefited from this initiative; she can get loans to boost her tailoring business. Moses Ouma and his group members are preparing land to plant pawpaws. This piece of land has been donated by one group member.\nThe success in this initiative has attracted other organization like the social services that have shown interest with the groups and they use these members to teach other people in various villages in the county on the same. This is a great move. The project has in turn benefited with grants from the government. Last year, we received a total of shilling 100,000. Through it we have also received donations of solar panels, projector, projector screen and a satellite dish worthy 200,000 from the ministry of ICT.\nWe give God all the glory for His doings.\n","caregiverlink":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/zHhaSHvYoRI","caregiverphotos":"[{ \"title\":\"KE0435 training caregivers on baking\",\"comment\":\"The caregiver mixing ingredients for cake\",\"size\":\"726.855\",\"name\":\"baking%20session.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_24e8tfuni4mypen\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"KE0435 Caregiver on training\",\"comment\":\"caregivers attending a training session \",\"size\":\"2867.313\",\"name\":\"CAREGIVERS%20TRAINING.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_jpxxmhja4hg39qq\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"KE0435 Table baking session\",\"comment\":\"group undertaking a table banking session.\",\"size\":\"3126.406\",\"name\":\"TABLE%20BANKING.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_nk2zzhm8r9six6a\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" }]","caregiverphotos[filecount]":"3","protectionwriteup":"","protectionlink":"","protectionphotos":"","protectionphotos[filecount]":"0"}},{"469":{"id":"469","submitdate":"2019-06-07 13:24:52","lastpage":"6","startlanguage":"en","seed":"1339788722","token":"ke0287kagkaembeni","startdate":"2019-06-06 19:26:54","datestamp":"2019-06-07 13:24:52","physicalwriteup":"                                        THE BIRTH OF HOLISTIC TRANSFORMATION\nBackground Information\nKE0287 KAG Kembeni Child Development Centre is found in Sokoke Ward in Ganze Sub-county in Kilifi County at the coastal region of Kenya. The Sub-county has an area of 2,938.63 square kilometers with a population of 132,688 and a low population density of 45 people per square kilometer (KNBS, 2010). It is the poorest constituency in Kenya with a poverty incidence of 84 per cent (Kenya, 2005). Being a semi-arid area with an average annual rainfall of 300mm-700mm, it is poorly endowed in terms of resources. The Project is located at an approximate distance of 7.5km from Matanomane shopping centre along Matanomane - Langobaya Road. KAG Kaembeni Child Development Centre started with 170 beneficiaries on 5th April 2018 and currently has 270 registered beneficiaries and 515 caregivers. The community is semi-rural with natives being Mijikenda community with about 5% non-locals. The community relies on subsistence farming mainly maize, cowpeas and green peas. The ballast quarry has also been a source of employment for many residents. Many residents live from hand to mouth as a result they find it difficult to educate their children and find good medical care for them as well.\nThe beneficiaries of age group 3-5 years are 144, those of age group 6-8 years are 116 and those of age group 9-11 years are 10 making a total of 270 beneficiaries. Most of the beneficiaries at the project are in lower primary and pre-primary school.\nWhen the project started, the biggest challenge was lack of sufficient infrastructural facilities able to provide an environment conducive for curriculum delivery, knowledge and skills acquisition among the registered children. There was only one mad walled dilapidated church hall; the church in collaboration with the caregivers were able to construct one incomplete semi-permanent classrooms (that are yet to be plastered and cemented, the third classroom is still under construction), a dilapidated temporary 2-door structure latrine serving 170 beneficiaries during the Saturday program, church members, caregivers during meeting, staff and pupils. This was the clear picture of the KAG Kaembeni Child Development\n In February 2019, we received Start up fund that have been utilized during the construction of the Modern toilet Ksh. 374,328.00, modern office block Ksh. 457,000.00 and kitchen renovation and wall enhancement Ksh.281,208.00. Caregivers\u2019 contribution towards these project amount to Ksh.104, 228.60 through provision of unskilled labor too.  \n\nToilet and Water Connection: \n\uf076\tOriginally, the two-door toilet consists of makeshift materials, hence completely open and without any privacy, lack of comfort or unsafe to use it due to high risk of disease.  There was a lot of dirt at our toilet and the flies were everywhere \u2013 we had to defecate by covering our noses.

The Sub-county has an area of 2,938.63 square kilometers with a population of 132,688 and a low population density of 45 people per square kilometer (KNBS, 2010). It is the poorest constituency in Kenya with a poverty incidence of 84 per cent (Kenya, 2005). Being a semi-arid area with an average annual rainfall of 300mm-700mm, it is poorly endowed in terms of resources. The Project is located at an approximate distance of 7.5km from Matanomane shopping centre along Matanomane - Langobaya Road. KAG Kaembeni Child Development Centre started with 170 beneficiaries on 5th April 2018 and currently has 270 registered beneficiaries and 515 caregivers. The community is semi-rural with natives being Mijikenda community with about 5% non-locals. The community relies on subsistence farming mainly maize, cowpeas and green peas. The ballast quarry has also been a source of employment for many residents. Many residents live from hand to mouth as a result they find it difficult to educate their children and find good medical care for them as well.\nThe beneficiaries of age group 3-5 years are 144, those of age group 6-8 years are 116 and those of age group 9-11 years are 10 making a total of 270 beneficiaries. Most of the beneficiaries at the project are in lower primary and pre-primary school.\nWhen the project started, the biggest challenge was lack of sufficient infrastructural facilities able to provide an environment conducive for curriculum delivery, knowledge and skills acquisition among the registered children. There was only one mad walled dilapidated church hall; the church in collaboration with the caregivers were able to construct one incomplete semi-permanent classrooms (that are yet to be plastered and cemented, the third classroom is still under construction), a dilapidated temporary 2-door structure latrine serving 170 beneficiaries during the Saturday program, church members, caregivers during meeting, staff and pupils. This was the clear picture of the KAG Kaembeni Child Development Centre.\nThe ICP\u2019s vision is to develop the child\u2019s mind spiritually by imparting knowledge, skills and attitude to enable them attain self-reliance thus making them a better generation for tomorrow. This couldn\u2019t be achieved without a conducive learning environment; an environment that is safe and conducive for learning. A proposal to build new classrooms was submitted by the Project and by the grace of God, it was funded Ksh. 3,235,600 the construction of three modern classrooms. However, as project caregivers decided to contribute  Ksh.293,90.20 through unskilled labor provision as 10% to enable building of a fourth classroom . This was a big step for the project but there was only one setback, there was no enough land where the four modern classrooms could be constructed. The church in partnership with the CPC mobilized funds from caregivers and other stakeholders and a land was purchased at a cost of Ksh 80,000 where all the four classrooms have been constructed. \n\n\n","cognitivelink":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=W5AK87FGceE","cognitivephotos":"[{ \"title\":\"\",\"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"2028.691\",\"name\":\"IMG20190511124058.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_43ivrpu62ck5bqp\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"\",\"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"3104.723\",\"name\":\"IMG20190503110516.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_c2tvwsp9saz5wd9\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"\",\"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"86.528\",\"name\":\"IMG-20190317-WA0081.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_qynf897hvhw9n2i\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"\",\"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"1698.932\",\"name\":\"IMG20190224170241.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_zv4pdmi35b83mqa\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" }]","cognitivephotos[filecount]":"4","spiritualwriteup":"","spirituallink":"","spiritualphotos":"","spiritualphotos[filecount]":"0","caregiverwriteup":"","caregiverlink":"","caregiverphotos":"","caregiverphotos[filecount]":"0","protectionwriteup":"","protectionlink":"","protectionphotos":"","protectionphotos[filecount]":"0"}},{"473":{"id":"473","submitdate":"2019-06-08 10:06:43","lastpage":"6","startlanguage":"en","seed":"2028636067","token":"ke599kagoloroito","startdate":"2019-06-07 06:26:14","datestamp":"2019-06-08 10:06:43","physicalwriteup":"","physicallink":"","physicalphotos":"","physicalphotos[filecount]":"0","socialwriteup":"KE0599 MENTOR-SHIP PROGRAM\n\nThis is a program that was started in the year 2014 August by the efforts of our staffs with the help of facilitators on holidays. \nMentorship program is a program that connects people who have specific skills and knowledge (mentors) with the youth\/ beneficiaries who need this skills and knowledge to break down life barriers and creates opportunities for success.\nReasons for the program.\nThis program was initiated as a result of the high number of teens in the project, high school drop outs, teenage pregnancies, and poor school performance.\nThe initiators also thought of enriching the youths with the following;\n-To build their self esteem\n-Provide them with the ability to maintain positive relationships among themselves and others.\n-Give them the understanding on decision making in career choices.\n-Help them understand their youth life challenges and how to manage them positively.\n-Help them understand themselves and body changes associated with their growth.\nChallenges experienced\nSome of the challenges we have experienced in the long run are;\n-\tBuilding youth\/ mentor relationship, it took some time to build trust\n            among the mentors and the beneficiaries.\n-\tResistance due to peer pressure, for them to avoid the program.\n-\tOutside negative forces i.e in their respective schools and homes.\n-\tTime limitation, i.e we have only the holidays to run the program plus the usual curriculum.\nThis has been a journey full of ups and downs but irrespective of the said few challenges, with prayer and devotion we have the fruits with us.\nBenefits of this program\nSome of the major benefits of this program are;\n-\tBetter grades in performance like we have our beneficiary No 272 being position 2 overall in the cluster with a mean grade of a B+.\n-\tVery few cases of pregnancies reported in the year and the few are reporting back to school to continue with their studies.\n-\tThey also relate with one another positively and also have developed their talents through this initiative, we have two of our beneficiaries N0 327 and No 121 sponsored abroad for different talent opportunities.\n-\tTheir self esteem is upright and they can make positive life decisions on their own.\nConclusion\nThis program has been a life saver to many of the beneficiaries and we appreciate the contribution of our PF towards such a wonderful program.

This activity was a suggestion of the youths themselves and after the project management having considered the idea, it was agreed that the youths be given the opportunity to explore this skill.\nTwo hair cutting machines were purchased at a cost of fifteen thousand, a cotton sheet, after shave chemicals and some hair brushes. The youths, under the instruction of the skills trainer, stated learning the basics of hair cutting theoretically, safety measures to be considered in the process and how to maintain hygiene during the exercise.\nThe next stage, learners started practicals of shaving stating with the basic hair cuts. The activity was always adventurers and given the number of youths interested, they were put in groups and hair cutting was done in exchanges. The youths would practice by shaving fellow beneficiaries under the instruction of the skills trainer and with time, they started perfecting. As at today, about fifteen youths can comfortably do nice hair cuts and this has become a normal routine after class activity for some youths.\nTo some youths, hair cutting is a skill they gained, to others, it an opportunity they got to have their long hair cut at zero cost and still to the FCP, it was a good opportunity to organize the youths into peer groups and increase positive interaction. During the activity, Cognitive lesson became a reality and practical since the youths were taught much concerning barber shop among other entrepreneurial activities that could be of help to the society in the future.

Prevention is better than cure and having knowledge for our physical wellbeing is our power for successful growth and development. Life is precious and is a gift that needs full care and protection\nIn order for a child to achieve the physical development outcome, there is need for church to invest so much on activities that seek promotion of child\u2019s health The church should there  focus on prevention measures  such as safe and healthy environments ,safe and healthy practices by staff and children.\nFor the children to experience the reduced incidences of illness, nutritional deficiencies and physical impediments; and ,for the children to be able to understand their body ,make life choices about their health and sexuality ,the church has invested in the following areas:\n1.\tIMPROVED HYGIENE AND SANITATION \nI.\tBetween January 2018 and June 2019,the church has so far strived to invest more than ksh 1,042,000 in constructing 11 toilets. This is a ratio of 1:24 which is  within ministry of education ratio requirements and standard for children use in an institution. Initially ,children did not even know how to use toilets because more than 90% of households had no toilets .However, currently all children are able to use toilets well and following right procedures of toilet use\nII.\tAt the beginning of the fy19,only 26 households had latrines. This was 9%. More than 235 households had no toilets following the baseline data for household hygiene and sanitation conducted in October 2018.You can imagine more 90% of beneficiaries had no latrines at their homes. The rate of illness was so high .However ,serious measures were taken by the church through Community-Led Total Sanitation(CLTS), so far more than 100 households have constructed latrines .This has greatly reduced incidences of illnesses like diarrhea  and scabies that was so common among children. \nThe children\u2019s health has drastically improved.\nThe church has invested more than ksh ksh120,000 on eye education, more than ksh 70,000 to create awareness on  personal and home hygiene ,more than ksh 150,000 for health screening and training which has enhanced children\u2019s health and are able to demonstrate health practices\n2.\tSUSTAINABLE FEEDING PROGRAM .\nThe church invests more than ksh 1,000,000 every year to make sure children have balanced died for tea break and lunch from Monday to Friday throughout the year. This has attracted program attendance because most of homes do not have 3-meals schedule  for a day.as a results the incidences of malnutrition has reduced.\n3.\tADEQUATE PLAY MATERIALS,SAFE AND HEALTH ENVIRONMENT\nI.\tThis has enhanced children participation in co-curricular activities like games and sports in our project\nII.\tThe church has already one of the most spacious stimulation room in the cluster which is fully equipped with materials necessary for physical development. More than 23 survival mothers and home-based beneficiaries have been greatly impacted with child morbidity and mortality being extremely low. No retarded growth reported too.

As a matter of fact, cognitive development is major aspects that defines child\u2019s ability to acquire skills, solve problems and make appropriate decisions for their life.\nThe cognitive outcome impact has been felt not only in cognitive domain but also in all other domains among all children; spiritual, physical and socio-emotional.\nAs  an outcome driven frontline church partner, the church has put so much effort that after just 4 years since the inception of the project, AIC KARARE has now become a \u201cCity on the Hill that cannot be hidden and a lamp on a lampstand whose light has shone enlightened everyone around\u2026(Mathew 5:14) .\nWhich are these effort?\n1.\tDuring FY19,the church invested around ksh 3,690,824 through support funds, parents contributions ,church donations and networking .This was around 55% of the annual budget.\n Why all this? \nI.\tThe reason for such investment is because ,apart from exhibiting skills and motivation to be economically self-supporting, when the child has access to quality education, that child will have knowledge to understand the reason for commitment to the lordship of Christ, will have knowledge  to interact with other people in healthy and compassionate manner and will have knowledge to choose good health practices.\nII.\tThe church has been able to sustain its annual activities towards this outcome achievements whereby it has so far:\na.\t8 permanent and 3 semi-permanent classrooms totaling to 11 classrooms which are spacious and adequate for all 265 the registered children who are in the church-based private school\nb.\tEmployed 9 highly qualified, experienced and born again  teachers with ECD DIPLOMA and TSC registered P1 certificate as the lowest qualification to ensure quality \nc.\tEnsured that teachers employed are also with games, sports ,drama and music skills so that children equipped with skills for self-reliance in future\nd.\t11 toilets which has a ratio of 1:24 which is  within ministry of education ratio requirements and therefore it can be concluded that the church has adequate facilities for proper hygiene and sanitation \n2.\tThis cognitive development strategy  has greatly enhanced local ownership of the FCP whereby the church and care-givers have consistently played their roles very well. For instance ,the care-givers have managed to own the feeding program that run from Monday to Friday for 3 terms , program that consume more that consume more than ksh 750,000\/- annually. They pay for food ,cooks and bring fire-word worth Ksh 4,000 per month for 12 months.\nOUTCOME IMPACT TO BENEFICIARIES.\n1.\tFrom the analysis made on both formative and summative assessments, it is clear overall performance indices among all beneficiaries has been on rise since 2017 and has now gone above average .There is hope for great future performance among these children if this trend continues consistently\n2.\tAll children ,including those in PP1 are now able to communicate in national language and English .As a result of this it now children themselves that write their letters to sponsors. Interestingly the annual gifts funds has increased from ksh 504,000 last fy18 to over ksh 850,000 in the fy 19.This is very interesting to see a child of 3 years in our locality being able to read and write.\n3.\tThe is no school drop-out, four years down the lime and it not expected because every child has now realized that access to education is their write\n4.\tMonitoring of children has become very easy because children are always around the project\n5.\tThe discipline among all children has been very impressing since 2017 until now\n\n\n","cognitivelink":"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1jF4xgzoaJWwbfmIwWhHtR0eN7w0HBQqM\/view?usp=drive_web","cognitivephotos":"[{ \"title\":\"ke250photo\",\"comment\":\"children in the morning assembly\",\"size\":\"149.198\",\"name\":\"ke250-children%20in%20the%20morning%20assemly.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_s27imierhticjd7\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"ke250foodstuff \",\"comment\":\"foodstuff for project feeding program\",\"size\":\"24.36\",\"name\":\"FOOD.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_jyjt5ktnqg5kpbp\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"ke250photo\",\"comment\":\"KE0250-PERMANENT CLASSROOMS for conducive learning\",\"size\":\"249.409\",\"name\":\"KE0250-PERMANENT%20CLASSROOMS.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_hzzvw8usp2te6kg\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"KE250PHOTO.BOOKS\",\"comment\":\"3000 books being distributed for free by build future initiatives \",\"size\":\"48.550000000000004\",\"name\":\"BOOKS.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_hqcndfvjbvs3p68\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"KEO2050\",\"comment\":\"view of classrooms and children\",\"size\":\"305.54200000000003\",\"name\":\"KEO2050-view%20of%20classrooms%20and%20children.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_jtj3qrwyjcykyaa\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" }]","cognitivephotos[filecount]":"5","spiritualwriteup":"Among all the aspects of human development, it only spiritual aspect that can  genuinely determines morality ,personality and character ,except the aspect of spiritual development. integrity, accountability, excellence and responsible living is anchored on understanding God\u2019s purposes and plans for one\u2019s life and living in fear and awe of the living God.

For instance in many places of Marsabit county, children start undergoing FGM as early as 9 yrs. Such children ,despite how young they are , they have no choices for marital partner. Early marriages are common here as long a child has undergone FGM and her parents have identified a partner even if is 80 years old. To fight this ,the church has vigorously created awareness to all beneficiary care-givers and put strict measures to make sure that any parent that force their child into early marriages and FGM will immediately be reported to authorities and arrested. All children have undergone vigorous child protection  training so that every child is aware of all harmful cultural practices.\nThe greatest achievement here is so far the FCP has 35 girls who are above 9 years and none of them us undergone either FGM or early marriage. This ia history in places like here.\nThe church has vowed that 100% of children shall not be victims of any harmful cultural practices experienced here. In the video clip backing this success story is Sipora Lechoi, child number KE025000008 narrating how child protection initiatives have rescued them from child abuse, neglect ,violence and exploitation.\n3.\tIn this community 80% have no faith for their children being treated in hospitals when it comes to serious illnesses and injuries like fractures and burns. Many mothers give birth at home instead of going to hospital.\nHowever this has changed for our beneficiaries. All our survival mothers have been able to give birth at hospitals. Sometimes ,the social worker had to take child no KE025000190 and KE025000121 to hospital after police notice to the police because their care-givers had refused to take their children to hospital after fracture.\nWe really appreciate God because things have changed for good.Halleluyah\n","protectionlink":"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1jF4xgzoaJWwbfmIwWhHtR0eN7w0HBQqM\/view?usp=drive_web","protectionphotos":"[{ \"title\":\"KE250CHILD PROTECTION PHOTO\",\"comment\":\"CARE-GIVERS RECEIVING AFTER COMPLETING CHILD PROTECTION CURRICULUM.\",\"size\":\"468.382\",\"name\":\"K0250-CARE-GIVERS%20RECEIVING%20AFTER%20COMPLETING%20CHILD%20PROTECTION%20CURRICULUM.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_fn7qyyzzswah5sj\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"CHILD PROTECTION PHOTO\",\"comment\":\"Children during child protection lesson\",\"size\":\"232.85500000000002\",\"name\":\"KE0250-CHILD%20PROTECTION%20LESSON.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_cg59cbhxt8qcs7h\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"KE0250-Internatinal day of zero tolerance for FGM photo\",\"comment\":\"anti-fgm campgain\",\"size\":\"204.514\",\"name\":\"KE0250-Internatinal%20day%20of%20zero%20tolerance%20for%20FGM.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_htc8de2zb56mdkr\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" }]","protectionphotos[filecount]":"3"}},{"495":{"id":"495","submitdate":"2019-06-07 13:25:27","lastpage":"6","startlanguage":"en","seed":"280145385","token":"ke0591","startdate":"2019-06-07 11:17:55","datestamp":"2019-06-07 13:25:27","physicalwriteup":"","physicallink":"","physicalphotos":"","physicalphotos[filecount]":"0","socialwriteup":"SUCCESSFUL STORY OF AGIFT FOR CHILD NO KE5910322- MARTIN TUPENET MURERO\nMartin Tupenet  Murero is our sponsored child KE5910322 The beneficiary has since received large gifts from his sponsor, through this gifts we were able to buy for him  40 sheep and 3 cows ,through this gift the Family livelihood has improved.

The project runs under the partnership with Compassion international Kenya. \nBrass band is a musical ensemble consisting of brass instruments and percussion. It\u2019s a musical group consisting entirely of brass instruments with a percussion section. Brass band include cornets, baritones, cymbals, drums, and trombones.\nThe ICP initiated brass band in July 2015. Training for the registered youth beneficiaries started in November 2015. This idea was born out of an innovation approach pioneered by the church youth and staff, and church leaders to promote youth participation in percussion gospel music.\nIn November 2015, thirty youths who had interest in brass band percussion music were recruited and training started immediately. The youths were initiated in to regular training and mentorship by facilitators from A.I.C Voi whom we networked with for the training.\nThese youths have since shown a lot of interest and commitment in the brass band and playing the percussion instruments. They have learnt a lot so far in playing the instruments and have participated in various occasions of importance such as: Curtain raising of the coast region soft talents held in April 2016 at Mama Ngina Gilrs high school, Public procession during the world anti corruption day held at Lungalunga in September 2016 and were awarded ksh 10,000 by the anti corruption authority, Gracing the Kinango cluster education funds drive where Kwale county governor was the chief guest in November 2016 raising Ksh 1.3 Million for the cluster education fund, Gracing the CKE POYA events for the last three years consecutively, and public procession during Kwale county day of the African child every year since 2016.\nCurrently different groups and institutions have been inviting our brass band to participate during their events at a small fee ranging between ksh 10,000 to Ksh 20,000 per event. Such include school graduations, weddings, government national events, and major county events.\nThe youths have been active in preaching the gospel by playing gospel music during crusades and other church events. The band attracts a big crowd that is usually thirsty to hear the word of God. Brass band is a modern way of doing evangelism\nBefore we started the brass band, our youths would miss the program and had little or no interest in our programs, but since then these youths never miss the program as they know they will learn new things in the band and generally play the brass band percussion instruments which they love doing.\nBrass band training and principles involve a lot of emphasis on: discipline, sacrifice, hard work and commitment. These are some of the core values and virtues instilled in the lives of these registered youths. Our brass band has helped us transform the youth into disciplined dependable people in our church and community at large.\nThe task is great, the demand is high, but with commitment and faith in God our brass band will go places and achieve a lot in Jesus\u2019 name.\n","physicallink":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ocs8xp2lvH8","physicalphotos":"[{ \"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"2009.236\",\"name\":\"ACK%20KWALE%20BAND.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_ssnsbs8dbxu9gad\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"2498.329\",\"name\":\"KE645%26596%20Brass%20band%20during%20a%20training%20session.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_34fu2cfc25jnm7t\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"1815.782\",\"name\":\"KE645%20BRASS%20BAND.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_pwqtc4exs95sydv\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"1999.1390000000001\",\"name\":\"KE645%20Brass%20band%20assemble%20during%20the%20public%20procession%20of%20day%20of%20the%20african%20child%20in%20June%202018%20at%20Menzamwenye%2C%20Lungalunga%20subcounty..jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_zeb2bfk9nq3qiie\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"1812.5\",\"name\":\"ACK%20KWALE%20BRASS%20BAND%20IN%20ACTION.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_csz5ccqgzk7hdxk\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" }]","physicalphotos[filecount]":"5","socialwriteup":"","sociallink":"","socialphotos":"","socialphotos[filecount]":"0","cognitivewriteup":"","cognitivelink":"","cognitivephotos":"","cognitivephotos[filecount]":"0","spiritualwriteup":"","spirituallink":"","spiritualphotos":"","spiritualphotos[filecount]":"0","caregiverwriteup":"","caregiverlink":"","caregiverphotos":"","caregiverphotos[filecount]":"0","protectionwriteup":"","protectionlink":"","protectionphotos":"","protectionphotos[filecount]":"0"}},{"509":{"id":"509","submitdate":"2019-06-07 15:30:51","lastpage":"6","startlanguage":"en","seed":"899472220","token":"ke710mckkinangocdc","startdate":"2019-06-07 15:26:41","datestamp":"2019-06-07 15:30:51","physicalwriteup":"N\/A","physicallink":"N\/A","physicalphotos":"","physicalphotos[filecount]":"0","socialwriteup":"N\/A","sociallink":"N\/A","socialphotos":"","socialphotos[filecount]":"0","cognitivewriteup":"N\/A","cognitivelink":"N\/A","cognitivephotos":"","cognitivephotos[filecount]":"0","spiritualwriteup":"The project came up with an initiative known as 'Fishing For Christ Program'.

We realized that majority of the muslim students were not at peace at their places where they were. We began having special summon specific to those students and one on one talk was initiated. We discovered that majority of them were passing through difficulties, hatred and maltreatment back at home because of their decision they had made to follow Christ.  So the program has been a home for their comfort and we usually pray for them and do counselling to ensure that they remain strong in Christ. \n\nSo far the first beneficiaries are now the one who are leading this program, and it has been so effective since they well versed with both religion and they are the living testimonies. We have introduced youth rally, discipleship program, counselling sessions, Bible studies, Quiet time and many others to ensure that the spiritual growth of our beneficiaries is taken care of.

The youth brought the request to the office, to have them trained the skill. At first, we saw it as a challenge considering the cost and its sustainability. Through the engagements with the pf, we agreed to team up with another project in the cluster, who had the same interest. We started the training by travelling quite a long distance, to access the trainers and the instruments. It even became a challenge, during the rainy seasons, as the roads are usually impassable. During the training, one of our beneficiaries was spotted to be best in soloing. The young man has mastered the skill and even become a co trainer, who trains the others whenever their is no teacher around. Slowly by slowly, the project started acquiring the basic instruments and eventually had a fully set to enable them train on their own.\r\nTheir hard work, determining and excellence has been recognised within and outside the county. We have received several invitations including the anti corruption day celebration, county day of an African child celebration, County inaugural ceremonies, Kilifi county malaria day celebration among others. The band also represented the coast region during the 2018 national soft talents.\r\nThis initiative has brought about behaviour change among the youth, as they spend any free time they have, practising rather than engaging in non beneficial activities. The exposure gotten has improved their interpersonal and intrapersonal skills through making of new friend.Having one of their own as a co trainers has inculcated leadership skills in them, as they can easily organise a training schedule for themselves and have their own training them. As an Islam dominated community, the band has also helped bring more people close to God. Its the project's hope that the band will help achieve its mission of spreading the gospel throughout the community!\r\n","sociallink":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/E50T4UXTbGo","socialphotos":"[{ \"title\":\"\",\"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"1976.57\",\"name\":\"KE0596%20-%20Leading%20Makaela%20academy%20in%20celebrating%20the%20kcpe%20results.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_9nad9wuukb7gskq\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"\",\"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"2078.2980000000002\",\"name\":\"KE0596-%20Presenting%20during%20Kilifi%20Malaria%20day.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_f5wper24vwta3it\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"\",\"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"2067.7580000000003\",\"name\":\"KE0596-%20Presenting%20the%20national%20anthem%20to%20the%20County%20Gevonor.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_ag24mzwhwh8n647\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"\",\"comment\":\"\",\"size\":\"2126.052\",\"name\":\"KE0596-%20With%20the%20rib%20crackers%20during%20the%20regional%20talents.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_zatqd8mbyajdtz2\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" }]","socialphotos[filecount]":"4","cognitivewriteup":"","cognitivelink":"","cognitivephotos":"","cognitivephotos[filecount]":"0","spiritualwriteup":"","spirituallink":"","spiritualphotos":"","spiritualphotos[filecount]":"0","caregiverwriteup":"","caregiverlink":"","caregiverphotos":"","caregiverphotos[filecount]":"0","protectionwriteup":"","protectionlink":"","protectionphotos":"","protectionphotos[filecount]":"0"}},{"523":{"id":"523","submitdate":"2019-06-08 13:40:21","lastpage":"6","startlanguage":"en","seed":"662136582","token":"ke731kilgorisscdcaic","startdate":"2019-06-08 11:34:31","datestamp":"2019-06-08 13:40:21","physicalwriteup":"","physicallink":"","physicalphotos":"","physicalphotos[filecount]":"0","socialwriteup":"","sociallink":"","socialphotos":"","socialphotos[filecount]":"0","cognitivewriteup":"The Project has saved the cost of firewood,unlike before.The project saves time,the meals are prepared on time.","cognitivelink":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/1kOf9FYGHUs","cognitivephotos":"[{ \"title\":\"Bio gas\",\"comment\":\"Office cook preparing tea\",\"size\":\"480.856\",\"name\":\"cook%2C%20preparing%20tea%20using%20the%20gas.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_ka65wkkrr3pqucn\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" }]","cognitivephotos[filecount]":"1","spiritualwriteup":"The installation of Bio gas has helped conserve the environment by reducing the deforestation.\nThe  gas  has saved many caregivers and youths time","spirituallink":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/1kOf9FYGHUs","spiritualphotos":"[{ \"title\":\"Bio gas\",\"comment\":\"Cook preparing tea\",\"size\":\"480.856\",\"name\":\"cook%2C%20preparing%20tea%20using%20the%20gas.JPG\",\"filename\":\"fu_gmi233k8zq2627q\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" }]","spiritualphotos[filecount]":"1","caregiverwriteup":"This intervention has enabled the church and the community to be enlightened on the current the technology and have realized that some wastes can be reused and be useful.

This was surely a milestone in our project and we are expecting better performances in the coming years. \nThe greatest motivators have been the family background, which every beneficiary would want to change, the challenges of being educated especially in a family where none of the family relatives have ever gone to university has been an influence to do better in class. They would love to influence their family positively through education.\nYearly Kiambu cluster Prize giving has been a great motivator for the best candidates receives good prices that raise the esteem of many beneficiaries. The prizes include laptops, Tablets, phones, and travel bags. This year we received a laptop, 3 tablets, 4 phones and 8 travel bags . This was a great price for us.\nSchool Fees payment has been a great influence to good performance considering the beneficiaries have come from humble background. All have benefited from regular fees and topups  while O126 John Kungu has benefited from Education CIV Fund that paid his school fees since form 2 all through to form four due to his exemplarily performance in KCSE.\nIn addition these beneficiaries are mentors to the other beneficiaries in the project because they help them to write letter and encourage them to engage in co-curricular activities that will not influence they academic performance negatively. These beneficiaries engage in sports, talents and scout.\nThey are also staunch and committed members of their local churches. \n","cognitivelink":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/IrXdqyJhFB0","cognitivephotos":"[{ \"title\":\"Kiambu Cluster Prize Giving Day\",\"comment\":\"Third from left Keo61100236  holding a Laptop he received\",\"size\":\"249.729\",\"name\":\"KE0611%20PHOTO%201%20-%20KIAMBU%20CLUSTER%20PRIZE%20GIVING.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_qqc6hcw8vmzm6r9\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"Kiambu Cluster Prize Giving \",\"comment\":\"From Right 8th, 10th and 11th Beneficiaries 0215, 0126 and 0232 recevied Tablets and travel bags  for scoring Bminus\",\"size\":\"224.606\",\"name\":\"KE0611%20PHOTO%202%20-%20KIAMBU%20CLUSTER%20PRIZE%20GIVING.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_tnge75mngv92kqz\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"Participation in Soft Talent in 2018\",\"comment\":\"Majority of this best performers in academics also participate in talents and sports, e.g in the photo some participated in folk song and other in modern dance\",\"size\":\"551.16\",\"name\":\"KE0611%20PHOTO%203%20%20-%20SOFT%20TALENT.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_itv2se8ppfpnm7y\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"Daystar Program Excandidate Retreat\",\"comment\":\"28 of the 2018 Excandidates, benefited from the 8 weeks program offered by Daystar University\",\"size\":\"622.917\",\"name\":\"KE0611%20PHOTO%204%20-%20EX%20CANDIDATES%20DAYSTAR%20PROGRAM.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_6s67pice6dnhvs6\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" },{ \"title\":\"Scout Awards\",\"comment\":\"KE061100126 - 4th right awarded with a trophy in a community activity \",\"size\":\"183.12\",\"name\":\"KE0611%20PHOTO%205%20-%200126%20IN%20A%20SCOUT%20AWARD.jpg\",\"filename\":\"fu_7fdn9jvbifxe94f\",\"ext\":\"jpg\" }]","cognitivephotos[filecount]":"5","spiritualwriteup":"","spirituallink":"","spiritualphotos":"","spiritualphotos[filecount]":"0","caregiverwriteup":"","caregiverlink":"","caregiverphotos":"","caregiverphotos[filecount]":"0","protectionwriteup":"","protectionlink":"","protectionphotos":"","protectionphotos[filecount]":"0"}},{"527":{"id":"527","submitdate":"2019-06-17 10:08:10","lastpage":"1","startlanguage":"en","seed":"1779225524","token":"ke247aickorrcdc","startdate":"2019-06-16 12:44:06","datestamp":"2019-06-17 17:33:13","physicalwriteup":"","physicallink":"","physicalphotos":"","physicalphotos[filecount]":"0","socialwriteup":"","sociallink":"","socialphotos":"","socialphotos[filecount]":"0","cognitivewriteup":"","cognitivelink":"","cognitivephotos":"","cognitivephotos[filecount]":"0","spiritualwriteup":"","spirituallink":"","spiritualphotos":"","spiritualphotos[filecount]":"0","caregiverwriteup":"","caregiverlink":"","caregiverphotos":"","caregiverphotos[filecount]":"0","protectionwriteup":"","protectionlink":"","protectionphotos":"","protectionphotos[filecount]":"0"}},{"529":{"id":"529","submitdate":"2019-06-16 15:44:09","lastpage":"6","startlanguage":"en","seed":"467856740","token":"ke590cdc","startdate":"2019-06-16 15:11:22","datestamp":"2019-06-16 15:44:09","physicalwriteup":"KE 590 CDC LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT:\nRaising a generation of champion leaders in olepolos maasai community has been one of the key focus in our project,We believe the best way to have better nation is to eastablish a strong foundation of leaderrship.KE59o Olepolos Mennonite Child Development centre is a Church-based organization dedicated to supporting less privileged children so as to deliver them from spiritual, social, physical and economic poverty.
